Introduction of Control Unit 

The Control Unit may be defined as a part of system for retrieving  of instructions in proper sequence and the interpretation  of each instruction and process applications with proper signal to the arithmetic unit. Control unit and arithmetical logical process each instruction using memory. 

The function of control unit or circuit is exist in every general purpose computer that’s work as a process of instructions, instruction word and proper sequence for the necessary signals to a particular section of the computer that section perform executions on instructions. 

Control unit have various types of components and memory devices. 

Instruction Word 

A Computer word is an order of characters that handle as a group. All word consist of a set of binary numbers and that’s meaning depend on several factors
