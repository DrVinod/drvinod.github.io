### Introduction to Data Structure
> The way information is organized in the memory of a computer is called a data structure

>A data structure is a way of organizing data that considers not only the items stored, but also their relationship to each other. Advance knowledge about the relationship between data items allows designing of efficient algorithms for the manipulation of data.

>- Many algorithms require that we use a proper representation of data to achieve efficiency.
>- This representation and the operations that are allowed for it are called data structures.
>- Each data structure allows insertion, access, deletion etc.

**Why do we need data structures?**

- Data structures allow us to achieve an important goal: component reuse
- Once each data structure has been implemented once, it can be used over and over again in various applications.
- Common data structures are Stacks, Queues, Lists, Trees, Graphs, Tables etc.

### Types of Data Structure/Classification of Data Structure

`Based on how the data items or operated it will classified into`

1. **Primitive Data Structure** : is one the data items are operated closest to the machine level instruction. Eg : int, char and double.

2. **Non-Primitive Data Structure** : is one that data items are not operated closest to machine level instruction.

  1. **Linear Data Structure** : In which the data items are stored in sequence order. Eg: Arrays, Lists, Stacks and Queues.

    **Linear Data Structures**

    1. List

      1. Array
        1. One Dimensional
        2. Multi-Dimensional
        3. Dynamic Array
        4. Matrix
          1. Sparse Matrix
      2. Linked List
        1. Single Linked List
        2. Double Linked List
        3. Circular Linked List
      3. Ordered List
        1. Stack
        2. Queue
          1. Circular Queue
          2. Priority Queue
        3. Deque

      **Dictionary (Associative Array)**

      1. Hash Table

    **Operations performed on any linear structure:**

    1. Traversal – Processing each element in the list
    2. Search – Finding the location of the element with a given value.
    3. Insertion – Adding a new element to the list.
    4. Deletion – Removing an element from the list.
    5. Sorting – Arranging the elements in some type of order.
    6. Merging – Combining two lists into a single list.

  2. **Non Linear Data Structure** : In which the order of data items is not presence. Eg : Trees, Graphs.

     **Non‐Linear Data Structures**

     1. Graph
       1. Adjacency List
       2. Adjacency Matrix
       3. Spanning Tree
     2. Tree
       1. M‐Way Tree
       2. B‐Tree
         1. 2‐3‐4 Tree
         2. B+ Tree
       3. Binary Tree
         1. Binary Search Tree
         2. Self‐Balancing Binary Search Tree
           1. AVL Tree
           2. Red‐Black Tree
           3. Splay Tree
         3. Heap
           1. Min Heap
           2. Max Heap
           3. Binary Heap
         4. Parse Tree
