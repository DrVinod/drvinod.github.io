1. Tools
2. JDK


### Tools you will need

For performing the java program, you will need a hardware and Software

**Hardware**

* Processor         :           Pentium200-MHz computer
* Memory           :           minimumof 64 MB of RAM (128 MB of RAM recommended).

**Software**

You also will need the following software’s:

* Operating System
* Linux or Windows 95/98/2000/XP operating system.
* Java JDK
* Microsoft Notepad or any other ASCII text editor

###Download JDK

For running Java programs in your system, you will have to download and install JDK kit from here
(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (current version is jdk 1.7).

### Setting Class path

Java is freely available on Oracle's Website. Download the latest version of JDK () (Java Development Kit) on
your operating system. Install JDK on your machine. Once you have installed Java on your machine you would need to set environment variable to point to correct installation directory.

**Setting up path for windows ( 2000/XP/vista/Window 7,8 )**
Assuming that you have installed Java in C:\ Program files/ Java / JDK directory
Step 1: Right click on my computer and select properties.
Step 2: Go to the Advance System Settings tab.
Step 3: Click on Environment Variables button.
Step 4: Now alter the path variable so that it also contains the path to JDK installed directory.
For e.g:- Change C:\windows/ system 32. to C:\windows/system 32; C:\program files / Java/ JDK.

**Setting up path for Linux , Unix , Solaris, free BSD**
Assuming that you have installed Java in /home/java/JDK directory, do the following:

Step 1: Environment variable path should be set to point where java binaries have been installed. Refer to your shell if you have trouble doing this.

For Example: If you use bash as your shell, then you would add following line to the end bash mc: export PATH=/ Path/to/java





### Popular Java Editors

To write your Java programs, you will need a text editor. There are even more sophisticated IDEsavailable in the market. But for now,you can consider one of the following:

* Notepad: On Windows machine, you can use any simple text editor like Notepad (Recommended for this tutorial), TextPad.
* Netbeans : Isa Java IDE that is open-source and free which can be downloaded from <http://www.netbeans.org/index.html>.
* Eclipse:Is also a Java IDE developed by the eclipse open-source community and can be downloaded from <http://www.eclipse.org/>.


### Java Development Kit(JDK)

Java is a recently developed, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented programming and runtime environment, consisting of:

1. A programming language
2. An API specification
3. A virtual machine specification

The JDK has as its primary components a collection of programming tools,including:

* appletviewer– this tool can be used to run and debug Java applets without a web browser
* apt – theannotation-processing tool
* extcheck– a utility that detects JAR file conflicts
* idlj –the IDL-to-Java compiler. This utility generates Java bindings from a givenJava IDL file.
* jabswitch– the Java Access Bridge. Exposes assistive technologies on Microsoft Windows systems.
* java –the loader for Java applications. This tool is an interpreter and can interpretthe class files generated by the
* javaccompiler. Now a single launcher is used for both development and deployment.The old deployment launcher, jre, no longer comes with Sun JDK, and instead ithas been replaced by this new java loader.
* javac –the Java compiler, which converts source code into Java bytecode
* javadoc –the documentation generator, which automatically generates documentation fromsource code comments
* jar – thearchiver, which packages related class libraries into a single JAR file. Thistool also helps manage JAR files.
* javafxpackager– tool to package and sign JavaFX applications
* jarsigner– the jar signing and verification tool
* javah –the C header and stub generator, used to write native methods
* javap –the class file disassembler
* javaws –the Java Web Start launcher for JNLP applications
* JConsole– Java Monitoring and Management Console
* jdb – thedebugger
* jhat–Java Heap Analysis Tool (experimental)
* jinfo –This utility gets configuration information from a running Java process orcrash dump. (experimental)
* jmap –This utility outputs the memory map for Java and can print shared object memorymaps or heap memory details of a given process or core dump. (experimental)
* jmc –Java Mission Control
* jps –Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool lists the instrumented HotSpot JavaVirtual Machines (JVMs) on the target system. (experimental)
* jrunscript– Java command-line script shell.
* jstack –utility that prints Java stack traces of Java threads (experimental)
* jstat –Java Virtual Machine statistics monitoring tool (experimental)
* jstatd – jstatdaemon (experimental)
* keytool –tool for manipulating the keystore
* pack200 –JAR compression tool
* policytool– the policy creation and management tool, which can determine policy for a Java runtime, specifying which permissions are available for code from various sources
* VisualVM– visual tool integrating several command-line JDK tools and light weight[clarification needed] performance and memory profiling capabilities
* wsimport– generates portable JAX-WS artifacts for invoking a web service.
* xjc – Partof the Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) API. It accepts an XML schema andgenerates Java classes. 

The JDK also called Java Development Kit is a super set of the JRE, and contains everything that is in the JRE, plus tools such as the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and applications.



### Java Runtime Environment JRE

The JRE is the software environment in which programs compiled for a typical JVM implementation can run. The runtime system includes:

* Code necessary to run Java programs, dynamically link native methods, manage memory, and handle exceptions
* Implementation of the JVM

The following figure shows the JRE and its components, including a typical JVM implementation's various modules and its functional position with respect to the JRE and class libraries.

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine, and other components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language. JRE does not contain tools and utilities such as compilers or debuggers for developing applets and applications.

###Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Java virtual Machine(JVM) is a virtual Machine that provides runtime environment to execute java byte code. The JVM doesn't understand Java typo, that's why you compile your *.java files to obtain *.class files that contain the bytecodes understandable by the JVM.

JVM control execution of every Java program. It enables features such as automated exception handling, Garbage-collected heap.
The JVM is an abstract computing machine, having an instruction set that uses memory. Virtual machines are often used to implement a programming language. The JVM is the cornerstone of the Java programming language. It is responsible for Java's cross-platform portability and the small size of its compiled code.

The Solaris JVM is used to execute Java applications. The Java compiler, javac, outputs bytecodes and puts them into a .class file. The JVM then interprets these bytecodes, which can then be executed by any JVM implementation, thus providing Java's cross-platform portability. The next two figures illustrate the traditional compile-time environment and the new portable Java compile-time environment.

####Sun Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler

The Sun Java JIT compiler, an integral part of the Solaris JVM, can accelerate execution performance many times over previous levels. Long-running, compute-intensive programs show the best performance improvement.

####JIT Compile Process

When the JIT compiler environment variable is on (the default), the JVM reads the .class file for interpretation and passes it to the JIT compiler. The JIT compiler then compiles the bytecodes into native code for the platform on which it is running. The next figure illustrates the JIT compile process.
