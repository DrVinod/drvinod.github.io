Difference between class and object

| **Properties** | **Class**                                | **Object**                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                | A class is a way of binding the data and  associated methods in a single unit | Class variable is knows as an object     |
|                | Whenever we start executing a JAVA program, the class will be loaded into  main memory with the help of class loader subsystem(a part of JVM) only once | After loading the class into main memory, objects can be created in n  number. |
|                | When the class id defined there is no memory space for data members  of a class | When an object is created we get the memory space for data members of  the class |
