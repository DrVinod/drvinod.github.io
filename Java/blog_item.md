## Constructors

* The general rule is that when a subclass is created Java will call the superclass constructor first and then call the subclass constructors in the order determined by the inheritance hierarchy
* If a superclass does not have a default constructor with no arguments, the subclass must explicitly call the superclass constructor with the appropriate arguments
