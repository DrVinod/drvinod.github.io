Memory buffer register; accumulators; Registers-Indexed, General purpose, Special purpose; overflow, carry, shift, scratch registers; stack pointers; floating point; status information and buffer registers. Instruction Link An instruction is a command given to the computer to perform a specified operation on given data. Each instruction consists of 2 parts: an opcode and an operand. The first part of an instruction, which specifies the operation, to be performed is known as opcode. The second part of an instruction called operand is the data on which computer perform the specified operation. As a computer understands instructions only in the form of 0 & 1, instruction and data are fed into the computer is a binary form. They are written in binary codes known as machine codes. For the convenience of this user the codes can be written in hexical form. Instructions are classified into the following three types according to their word length: Single Byte Instruction Two Byte Instruction Three Byte Instruction Addressing Link Addressing techniques: Addressing modes are the method used to determine which part of memory is being referred to by a machine instruction. There are various types of addressing modes. Which addressing mode is used is dependent on what type of is being used. Random access memory (RAM) is the primary area of memory for a computer. This is where any application must be loaded to if it is to be run. The central processing unit reads machine instructions from the RAM and acts on those instructions. This is what happens whenever any application is run on a computer. The machine instructions given to the CPU often must refer to specific portions of the RAM. In order to do this, the CPU must have a way of knowing which portion of RAM the machine instruction is referring to. This is where addressing modes come into play. Addressing modes are used to divide up the sections of RAM into individual portions that may be referenced individually. This is similar to how each house has an address. This address can then be used by a machine instruction to refer to a specific portion of memory. The CPU will then access that portion of memory and perform the action specified by the machine instruction. There are many different types of addressing modes. Different types of computer architecture feature different types of addressing modes. This results in an incompatibility of software. If an application is designed for one type of addressing mode, then it will not be able to run when used on a system that uses a different type of addressing mode. It will be much like speaking to someone in a language he does not understand. The specifics of each type of addressing mode are important for computer programmers using assembly language. This type of is a direct representation of the machine instructions sent to the CPU. This is what makes assembly language able to produce programs that can run several times faster than other programming languages. Assembly language is used in the development of operating systems. A computer programmer must know the type of addressing modes used on the specific computer architecture before he can write a functioning operating system or application in assembly. The differences between addressing modes are part of the reason that applications are unable to run on different computer architectures. Direct addressing Link In direct addressing mode, effective address of the operand is given in the address field of the instruction. It requires one memory reference to read the operand from the given location and provides only a limited address space. Length of the address field is usually less than the word length. Ex : Move P, Ro, Add Q, Ro P and Q are the address of operand. A very simple form of addressing is direct addressing, in which: Address field contains address of operand Effective address (EA) = address field (A) e.g. ADD A ;Add contents of cell A to accumulator. The technique was common in earlier generations of computers but is not common on contemporary architectures. It requires only one memory reference and no spe\u00adcial calculation. The obvious limitation is that it provides only a limited address space. Indirect addressing Link Indirect addressing mode, the address field of the instruction refers to the address of a word in memory, which in turn contains the full length address of the operand. The advantage of this mode is that for the word length of N, an address space of 2N can be addressed. He disadvantage is that instruction execution requires two memory reference to fetch the operand Multilevel or cascaded indirect addressing can also be used. With direct addressing, the length of the address field is usually less than the word length, thus limiting the address range. One solution is to have the address field refer to the address of a word in memory, which in turn contains a full-length address of the operand. This is known as indirect addressing. Immediate addressing Link This is the simplest form of addressing. Here, the operand is given in the instruction itself. This mode is used to define a constant or set initial values of variables. The advantage of this mode is that no memory reference other than instruction fetch is required to obtain operand. The disadvantage is that the size of the number is limited to the size of the address field, which most instruction sets is small compared to word length. The simplest way for an instruction to specify an operand is for the address part of the instruction actually to contain the operand itself rather than an address or other information describing where the operand is. Such an operand is called an immediate operand because it is automatically fetched from memory at the same time the instruction itself is fetched; hence it is immediately available for use. A possible immediate instruction for loading register R1 with the constant 4 is shown in Fig. 5-17. The simplest form of addressing is immediate addressing, in which the operand is actually present in the instruction: Operand is part of instruction Operand = address field e.g. ADD 5 ;Add 5 to contents of accumulator ;5 is operand. op-code operand The advantage of immediate addressing is that no memory reference other than the instruction fetch is required to obtain the operand, thus saving one mem\u00adory or cache cycle in the instruction cycle. The disadvantage is that the size of the number is restricted to the size of the address field, which, in most instruction sets, is small compared with the word length. Relative addressing Link This is a combination of direct addressing and register indirect addressing. The value contained in one address field. A is used directly and the other address refers to a register whose contents are added to A to produce the effective address. Indexed addressing- It is also known as direct addressing mode. When you know the right offset of the address of the memory you need. For example if you have an array, then if you need the N-th element of the array, you just add N sizes of the variables to the starting address of the array. As an oposite it is the sequential addressing mode (or indirect) where you cant calculate the exact address by just offset of the beginning. If the size of each element in the array is not known (for example if you have N null terminated string which size is not known) you need to traverse all the N-1 elements until you find the one you need - the N-th one :) Register Addressing Link Register addressing is similar to direct addressing. The only difference is that the address field refers to a register rather than a main memory address. The advantages of register addressing are that : Only a small address field is needed in the instruction No memory 'references are required, faster instruction fetch The disadvantage of register addressing is that the address space is very limited. Register Indirect Addressing: Link Just as register addressing is analogous to direct addressing, register indirect ad\u00addressing is analogous to indirect addressing. In both cases, the only difference is whether the address field refers to a memory location or a register. Thus, for register indirect address: Operand is in memory cell pointed to by contents of register. Displacement Addressing: Link A very powerful mode of addressing combines the capabilities of direct addressing and register indirect addressing. It is known by a variety of names depending on the context of its use but the basic mechanism is the same. We will refer to this as displacement addressing, address field hold two values: A = base value R = register that holds displacement. Autoincrement /Autodecrement Mode Link A special case of indirect register mode. The register whose number is included in the instruction code, contains the address of the operand. Autoincrement Mode = after operand addressing , the contents of the register is incremented. Decrement Mode = before operand addressing, the contents of the register is decrement. Example: SPIM/SAL - - simulating autoincrement/autodecrement addressing mode (**MIPS **has no autoincrement/autodecrement mode) lw $3, array1($17) #load in reg. $3 word at address array1($17) addi $17,$17,4 #increment address (32-bit words) after accessing #operand this can be re-written in a \"autoincrement like mode\": lw+ $3,array1($17) # lw+ is not a real MIPS instruction subi $17,$17,4 # decrement address before accessing the operand lw $3,array1($17) NOTE: the above sequence can be re-rewritten proposing an \"autodecrement instruction\", not real in MIPS architecture. -lw $3, array1($17) Register Link Introduction Link A CPU contains a number of register to store data temporarily during the execution of a program. The number of registers differs from processor to processor. Register are classified as follows : General Purpose Registers Accumulator Special Purpose Register General Purpose Registers Link There registers store data & intermediate results during execution of a program. They are accessible to users through instructions if the users are working in assembly language. Store data (arguments and result of instructions.) can be assinged variety of user programmes. Accumulator Link Its the most important GPR having multiple functions. It\u201f s most efficient in data movement, arithmetic and logical operation. It has some special features that the other GPR do not have. After the execution of arithmetic and logical instruction the result is placed in the accumulator. Accumulators on a tabulating machine circa 1936. Each of the four registers can store a 10-digit decimal number. In a computer's central processing unit (CPU), an accumulator is a register in which intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored. Without a register like an accumulator, it would be necessary to write the result of each calculation (addition, multiplication, shift, etc.) to main memory, perhaps only to be read right back again for use in the next operation. Access to main memory is slower than access to a register like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower (but cheaper) than that used for a register. The canonical example for accumulator use is summing a list of numbers. The accumulator is initially set to zero, then each number in turn is read and added to the value in the accumulator. Only when all numbers have been added is the result held in the accumulator written to main memory or to another, non-accumulator, CPU register. An accumulator machine, also called a 1-operand machine, or a CPU with accumulator-based architecture, is a kind of CPU where, although it may have several registers, the CPU mostly stores the results of calculations in one special register, typically called \"the accumulator\". Historically almost all early computers were accumulator machines; and many microcontrollers still popular as of 2010 (such as the 68HC12, the PICmicro, the 8051 and several others) are basically accumulator Special Purpose Register Link A CPU contains a number of special purpose register for different purposes. Responsible for storing information that is essential for running DLX programs. Types are : Program Counter (PC) Stack Pointer (SP) Instruction Register (IR) Index Register Memory Address Register (MAR) Memory Buffer Register (MBR) Program Counter (PC) Link Stack Pointer (SP) Link A stack pointer is a small register that stores the address of the last program request in a stack. A stack is a specialized buffer which stores data from the top down. As new requests come in, they \"push down\" the older ones. The most recently entered request always resides at the top of the stack, and the program always takes requests from the top. A stack (also called a pushdown stack) operates in a last-in/first-out sense. When a new data item is entered or \"pushed\" onto the top of a stack, the stack pointer increments to the next physical memory address, and the new item is copied to that address. When a data item is \"pulled\" or \"popped\" from the top of a stack, the item is copied from the address of the stack pointer, and the stack pointer decrements to the next available item at the top of the stack. Instruction Register (IR) Link Index Register Link computer\u2019s cpu is a processor register used for modifying operand addresses during the run of a program, typically for doing vector/array oprations. Index register were first used in the British Manchester mark 1 computer,in 1949. Index register are used for a special kind of addressing where an immdiate constant (i.e., which is part of the instruction it self) is added to the content of a register to form the actual operands or data; architecture which allow more then one register to be used this way nuturally have an opcode field for specifiying which register to use. Memory Address Register (MAR) Link Memory Buffer Register (MBR) Link A Memory Buffer Register (MBR) is the register in a computer 's processor, or central processing unit , CPU, that stores the data being transferred to and from the immediate access store. It acts as a buffer allowing the processor and memory units to act independently without being affected by minor differences in operation. A data item will be copied to the MBR ready for use at the next clock cycle, when it can be either used by the processor or stored in main memory. This register holds the contents of the memory which are to be transferred from memory to other components or vice versa. A word to be stored must be transferred to the MBR, from where it goes to the specific memory location, and the arithmetic data to be processed in the ALU first goes to MBR and then to accumulated register, and then it is processed in the ALU. Overflow register Link that the signed result of an opretion is too large to fit in the register width using twos complement representation. Carry register Link store numbers large than a single word to be added /subtracted by carrying a binary digit from a less significant word to the large significent bit of a more significent word as needed.it is also used to extend bit shifts and rotates in a similar manner on many processor. Shift register Link the shift register is another type of sequential logic circuit that is used for the storage or transfer of data in the form of binary numbers and than \u201cshift\u201d the data out once every clock cycle, hence the name shift register.it basically consists of several single bit \u201cD-type data latches\u201d, one for each bit (0-1) connected together in a serial or daisy-chain arrangment so that the output from one data latch becomes the input of the next latch and so on. The data bits may be fed in or out of the register serially,i.e. one after the other from either the left or the right direction, or in parllel,i.e. all together. The number of individual data latches required to make up a singnal shift register is determinde by the number of bits to be stored with the most common being 8-bits wide. Stack register Link A stack can be orgnized as a collection of finite number of register that are used to store temporary information during the execution of a program. The stack pointer(sp)is a register that holds the address of top of element of the stack. Floating Point Register Link In computing , floating point describes a method of representing an approximation to real numbers in a way that can support a wide range of values. The numbers are, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the mantissa) and scaled using an exponent . The base for the scaling is normally 2, 10 or 16. The typical number that can be represented exactly is of the form: Significant digits \u00d7 baseexponent The idea of floating-point representation over intrinsically integer fixed-point numbers, which consist purely of significand , is that expanding it with the exponent component achieves greater range. For instance, to represent large values, e.g. distances between galaxies, there is no need to keep all 39 decimal places down to femtometre -resolution, employed in particle physics. Assuming that the best resolution is in light years , only 9 most significant decimal digits matter whereas 30 others bear pure noise and, thus, can be safely dropped. This is 100-bit saving in storage. Instead of these 100 bits, much fewer are used to represent the scale (the exponent), e.g. 8 bits or 2 decimal digits. Now, one number can encode the astronomic and subatomic distances with the same 9 digits of accuracy. But, because 9 digits are 100 times less accurate than 9+2 digits reserved for scale, this is considered as precision -for-range trade-off . The example also explains that using scaling to extend the dynamic range results in another contrast with usual fixed-point numbers: their values are not uniformly spaced. Small values, the ones close to zero, can be represented with much higher resolution (1 femtometre) than distant ones because greater scale (light years) must be selected for encoding significantly larger values.[ 1] That is, floating-point cannot represent point coordinates with atomic accuracy in the other galaxy, only close to the origin. The term floating point refers to the fact that their radix point (decimal point, or, more commonly in computers, binary point) can \"float\"; that is, it can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number. This position is indicated as the exponent component in the internal representation, and floating-point can thus be thought of as a computer realization of scientific notation . Over the years, a variety of floating-point representations have been used in computers. However, since the 1990s, the most commonly encountered representation is that defined by the IEEE 754 Standard. The speed of floating-point operations, commonly referred to in performance measurements as FLOPS , is an important machine characteristic, especially in software that performs large-scale mathematical calculations. Status information and buffer registers Link A buffer register is the simplest kind of register; all it does is store a digital information temporarily. It holds the contents of the memory which are to be transferred from memory to other components. By acting as a buffer, it allows the central processor and memory units to operate independently without being affected by minor differences in operation. Integrated Circuit Link An integrated circuit (IC) can be the equivalent of dozens, hundreds, or thousands of separate electronic parts. Digital ICs, such as microprocessors, can equal millions of parts. Now, digital and mixed signal ICs are finding more applications in analog systems. The integrated circuit was introduced in 1958. It has been called the most significant technological development of the twentieth century. Integrated circuits have allowed electronics to expand at an amazing rate. Much of the growth has been in the area of digital electronics. Lately, analog ICs have received more attention, and the designation \u201cmixed-signal\u201d is now applied to ICs that combine digital and analog functions. Electronics is growing rapidly. One major reason is the advance in performance while costs remain stable and sometimes decrease. Circuits have become a lot smaller, more reliable, and more energy efficient. Witness the many portable devices available today. Integrated circuit technology is the major force behind the growth in the electronics industry. Consider that many systems and devices that we now enjoy were not practical or even possible a decade ago. Discrete circuits use individual resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and other devices to achieve the circuit function. These individual or discrete parts must be interconnected. The usual approach is to use a circuit board. This method, however, increases the cost of the circuit. The board, assembly, soldering, and testing all make up a part of the cost. Integrated circuits do not eliminate the need for circuit boards, assembly, soldering, and testing. However, with ICs the number of discrete parts can be reduced. This means that the circuit boards can be smaller, often use less power, and that they will cost less to produce. It may also be possible to reduce the overall size of the equipment by using integrated circuits, which can reduce costs in the chassis and cabinet. Integrated circuits may lead to circuits that require fewer alignment steps at the factory. This is especially true with digital devices. Alignment is expensive, and fewer steps mean lower costs. Also, variable components are more expensive than fixed components, and if some components can be eliminated, savings are realized. Finally, variable components are not as reliable as fixed components. There are various style in packaging of Integrated circuits DIP (dual in-line package) SOJ (small outline J leads) TSOP (thin small outline package) QFJ (quad flat J leads) TQFP (thin quad flat package) TCP (tape carrier package) BGA (ball grid array) CSP (chip-size package) SOP(small outline package) SSOP(shrink small outline package) ZIP(zigzag in-line package) QFP(quad flat package) LQFP(low-profile quad flat package) PGA(pin grid array) LGA(land grid array) Small-Scale Integration (SSI) Link SSI devices contain several independent electronic components in a single package. The inputs and outputs are connected directly to the pins in the package. The number of components is less than 10 in every package. Logic Gates like inverters, AND gate, OR gate and etc. are products of SSI. Medium Scale Integration (MSI) Link MSI devices has a complexity of 10 to 100 electronic components in a single package. They usually perform basic and specific digital operations and includes decoders, adders, counters, multiplexers, and demultiplexers. Large Scale Integration (LSI) Link Products of LSI contain between 100 and 10,000 electronic components in a single package. They include memory modules, I/O controllers, and 4-bit microprocessor systems. Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Link Devices that are results of VLSI contain between 10,000 and 300,000 electronic components. VLSI produces large memory modules and 8bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microprocessor systems. Super Large Scale Integration (SLSI) Link This kind is a new type of integration which produces ICs having more than 300,000 electronic components in one package. Examples of devices which use SLSI are 64-bit microprocessor systems and microcontrollers. Buses, Types of buses, Bus Interconnections Link Bus Interconnection Link A bus is a communication pathway connecting two or more devices. Bus is a shared transmission medium. Multiple devices connect to the bus, and a signal transmitted by any one device is available for reception by all other devices attached to the bus. If two devices transmit during the same time period, their signals will overlap and become garbled. Thus, only one device at a time can successfully transmit. Typically, a bus consists of multiple communication pathways, or lines. Each line is capable of transmitting signals representing binary 1 and binary 0. Over time, a sequence of binary digits can be transmitted across a single line. Taken together, several lines of a bus can be used to transmit binary digits simultaneously (in parallel). For example, an 8-bit unit of data can be transmitted over eight bus lines. Computer systems contain a number of different buses that provide pathways between components at various levels of the computer system hierarchy. The most common computer interconnection structures are based on the use of one or more system buses (Control buses, Address Buses, Data Lines). Bus Structure Link A system bus consists, typically, of from about 50 to hundreds of separate lines. Each line is assigned a particular meaning or function. Although there are many different bus designs, on any bus the lines can be classified into three functional groups data, address, and control lines. In addition, there may be power distribution lines that supply power to the attached modules. The data lines provide a path for moving data among system modules. These lines, collectively, are called the data bus. The data bus may consist of 32, 64, 128, or even more separate lines, the number of lines being referred to as the width of the data bus. Because each line can carry only 1 bit at a time, the number of lines determines how many bits can be transferred at a time. The width of the data bus is a key factor in determining overall system performance. For example, if the data bus is 32 bits wide and each instruction is 64 bits long, then the processor must access the memory module twice during each instruction cycle. The address lines are used to designate the source or destination of the data on the data bus. For example, if the processor wishes to read a word (8, 16, or 32 bits) of data from memory, it puts the address of the desired word on the address lines. Clearly, the width of the address bus determines the maximum possible memory capacity of the system. Furthermore, the address lines are generally also used to address I/O ports. Typically, the higher-order bits are used to select a particular module on the bus, and the lower-order bits select a memory location or I/O port within the module. For example, on an 8-bit address bus, address 01111111 and below might reference locations in a memory module (module 0) with 128 words of memory, and address 10000000 and above refer to devices attached to an I/O module (module 1). The control lines are used to control the access to and the use of the data and address lines. Because the data and address lines are shared by all components, there must be a means of controlling their use. Control signals transmit both command and timing information among system modules. Timing signals indicate the validity of data and address information. Command signals specify operations to be performed. Typical control lines include Memory write: Causes data on the bus to be written into the addressed location Memory read: Causes data from the addressed location to be placed on the bus I/O write: Causes data on the bus to be output to the addressed I/O port I/O read: Causes data from the addressed I/O port to be placed on the bus Transfer ACK: Indicates that data have been accepted from or placed on the bus Bus request: Indicates that a module needs to gain control of the bus Bus grant: Indicates that a requesting module has been granted control of the bus Interrupt request: Indicates that an interrupt is pending Interrupt ACK: Acknowledges that the pending interrupt has been recognized Clock: Is used to synchronize operations Reset: Initializes all modules The operation of the bus is as follows. If one module wishes to send data to another, it must do two things: Obtain the use of the bus, and transfer data via the bus. If one module wishes to request data from another module, it must Obtain the use of the bus, and transfer a request to the other module over the appropriate control and address lines. It must then wait for that second module to send the data. Physically, the system bus is actually a number of parallel electrical conductors. In the classic bus arrangement, these conductors are metal lines etched in a card or board (printed circuit board). The bus extends across all of the system components, each of which taps into some or all of the bus lines. \u202f METHOD OF ARBITRATION Link In all but the simplest systems, more than one module may need control of the bus. For example, an I/O module may need to read or write directly to memory, without sending the data to the processor. Because only one unit at a time can successfully transmit over the bus, some method of arbitration is needed. The various methods can be roughly classified as being either centralized or distributed. In a centralized scheme, a single hardware device, referred to as a bus controller or arbiter, is responsible for allocating time on the bus. The device may be a separate module or part of the processor. In a distributed scheme, there is no central controller. Rather, each module contains access control logic and the modules act together to share the bus. With both methods of arbitration, the purpose is to designate one device, either the processor or an I/O module, as master. The master may then initiate a data transfer (e.g., read or write) with some other device, which acts as slave for this particular exchange. I/O versus Memory Bus In addition to communicating with I/O, the processor must communicate with the memory unit. Like the I/O bus, the memory bus contains data, address, and read/write control lines. There are three ways that computer buses can be used to communicate with memory and I/O: Use two separate buses, one for memory and the other for I/O. Use one common bus for both memory and I/O but have separate control lines for each. Use one common bus for memory and I/O with common control lines. In the first method, the computer has independent sets of data, address, and control buses, one for accessing memory and the other for I/O. This is done in computers that provide a separate I/O processor (IOP) in addition to the central processing unit (CPU). \"The memory communicates with both the CPU and the IOP through a memory bus. The IOP communicates also with the input and output devices through a separate I/O bus with its own address, data and control lines. The purpose of the IOP is to provide an independent pathway for the transfer of information between external devices and internal memory. The I/O processor is sometimes called a data channel.","title":"UnitIV"},{"location":"de/UnitIV/#unit-iv","text":"Addressing techniques and registers: Addressing techniques-Direct, immediate addressing; paging, relative, Indirect and indexed addressing.

There are various types of addressing modes. Which addressing mode is used is dependent on what type of is being used. Random access memory (RAM) is the primary area of memory for a computer. This is where any application must be loaded to if it is to be run. The central processing unit reads machine instructions from the RAM and acts on those instructions. This is what happens whenever any application is run on a computer. The machine instructions given to the CPU often must refer to specific portions of the RAM. In order to do this, the CPU must have a way of knowing which portion of RAM the machine instruction is referring to. This is where addressing modes come into play. Addressing modes are used to divide up the sections of RAM into individual portions that may be referenced individually. This is similar to how each house has an address. This address can then be used by a machine instruction to refer to a specific portion of memory. The CPU will then access that portion of memory and perform the action specified by the machine instruction. There are many different types of addressing modes. Different types of computer architecture feature different types of addressing modes. This results in an incompatibility of software. If an application is designed for one type of addressing mode, then it will not be able to run when used on a system that uses a different type of addressing mode. It will be much like speaking to someone in a language he does not understand. The specifics of each type of addressing mode are important for computer programmers using assembly language. This type of is a direct representation of the machine instructions sent to the CPU. This is what makes assembly language able to produce programs that can run several times faster than other programming languages. Assembly language is used in the development of operating systems. A computer programmer must know the type of addressing modes used on the specific computer architecture before he can write a functioning operating system or application in assembly. The differences between addressing modes are part of the reason that applications are unable to run on different computer architectures.","title":"Addressing"},{"location":"de/UnitIV/#direct-addressing","text":"In direct addressing mode, effective address of the operand is given in the address field of the instruction. It requires one memory reference to read the operand from the given location and provides only a limited address space. Length of the address field is usually less than the word length.

A very simple form of addressing is direct addressing, in which: Address field contains address of operand Effective address (EA) = address field (A) e.g. ADD A ;Add contents of cell A to accumulator.

With direct addressing, the length of the address field is usually less than the word length, thus limiting the address range.

The disadvantage is that the size of the number is limited to the size of the address field, which most instruction sets is small compared to word length. The simplest way for an instruction to specify an operand is for the address part of the instruction actually to contain the operand itself rather than an address or other information describing where the operand is. Such an operand is called an immediate operand because it is automatically fetched from memory at the same time the instruction itself is fetched; hence it is immediately available for use. A possible immediate instruction for loading register R1 with the constant 4 is shown in Fig. 5-17. The simplest form of addressing is immediate addressing, in which the operand is actually present in the instruction: Operand is part of instruction Operand = address field e.g. ADD 5 ;Add 5 to contents of accumulator ;5 is operand. op-code operand The advantage of immediate addressing is that no memory reference other than the instruction fetch is required to obtain the operand, thus saving one mem\u00adory or cache cycle in the instruction cycle.

Each of the four registers can store a 10-digit decimal number. In a computer's central processing unit (CPU), an accumulator is a register in which intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored. Without a register like an accumulator, it would be necessary to write the result of each calculation (addition, multiplication, shift, etc.) to main memory, perhaps only to be read right back again for use in the next operation. Access to main memory is slower than access to a register like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower (but cheaper) than that used for a register. The canonical example for accumulator use is summing a list of numbers. The accumulator is initially set to zero, then each number in turn is read and added to the value in the accumulator. Only when all numbers have been added is the result held in the accumulator written to main memory or to another, non-accumulator, CPU register.

The numbers are, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the mantissa) and scaled using an exponent . The base for the scaling is normally 2, 10 or 16. The typical number that can be represented exactly is of the form: Significant digits \u00d7 baseexponent The idea of floating-point representation over intrinsically integer fixed-point numbers, which consist purely of significand , is that expanding it with the exponent component achieves greater range. For instance, to represent large values, e.g. distances between galaxies, there is no need to keep all 39 decimal places down to femtometre -resolution, employed in particle physics. Assuming that the best resolution is in light years , only 9 most significant decimal digits matter whereas 30 others bear pure noise and, thus, can be safely dropped. This is 100-bit saving in storage. Instead of these 100 bits, much fewer are used to represent the scale (the exponent), e.g. 8 bits or 2 decimal digits. Now, one number can encode the astronomic and subatomic distances with the same 9 digits of accuracy. But, because 9 digits are 100 times less accurate than 9+2 digits reserved for scale, this is considered as precision -for-range trade-off . The example also explains that using scaling to extend the dynamic range results in another contrast with usual fixed-point numbers: their values are not uniformly spaced. Small values, the ones close to zero, can be represented with much higher resolution (1 femtometre) than distant ones because greater scale (light years) must be selected for encoding significantly larger values.[ 1] That is, floating-point cannot represent point coordinates with atomic accuracy in the other galaxy, only close to the origin. The term floating point refers to the fact that their radix point (decimal point, or, more commonly in computers, binary point) can \"float\"; that is, it can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number. This position is indicated as the exponent component in the internal representation, and floating-point can thus be thought of as a computer realization of scientific notation . Over the years, a variety of floating-point representations have been used in computers. However, since the 1990s, the most commonly encountered representation is that defined by the IEEE 754 Standard.

It has been called the most significant technological development of the twentieth century. Integrated circuits have allowed electronics to expand at an amazing rate. Much of the growth has been in the area of digital electronics. Lately, analog ICs have received more attention, and the designation \u201cmixed-signal\u201d is now applied to ICs that combine digital and analog functions. Electronics is growing rapidly. One major reason is the advance in performance while costs remain stable and sometimes decrease. Circuits have become a lot smaller, more reliable, and more energy efficient. Witness the many portable devices available today. Integrated circuit technology is the major force behind the growth in the electronics industry. Consider that many systems and devices that we now enjoy were not practical or even possible a decade ago. Discrete circuits use individual resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and other devices to achieve the circuit function. These individual or discrete parts must be interconnected. The usual approach is to use a circuit board. This method, however, increases the cost of the circuit. The board, assembly, soldering, and testing all make up a part of the cost. Integrated circuits do not eliminate the need for circuit boards, assembly, soldering, and testing. However, with ICs the number of discrete parts can be reduced. This means that the circuit boards can be smaller, often use less power, and that they will cost less to produce. It may also be possible to reduce the overall size of the equipment by using integrated circuits, which can reduce costs in the chassis and cabinet. Integrated circuits may lead to circuits that require fewer alignment steps at the factory. This is especially true with digital devices. Alignment is expensive, and fewer steps mean lower costs. Also, variable components are more expensive than fixed components, and if some components can be eliminated, savings are realized.

Bus is a shared transmission medium. Multiple devices connect to the bus, and a signal transmitted by any one device is available for reception by all other devices attached to the bus. If two devices transmit during the same time period, their signals will overlap and become garbled. Thus, only one device at a time can successfully transmit. Typically, a bus consists of multiple communication pathways, or lines. Each line is capable of transmitting signals representing binary 1 and binary 0. Over time, a sequence of binary digits can be transmitted across a single line. Taken together, several lines of a bus can be used to transmit binary digits simultaneously (in parallel). For example, an 8-bit unit of data can be transmitted over eight bus lines. Computer systems contain a number of different buses that provide pathways between components at various levels of the computer system hierarchy. The most common computer interconnection structures are based on the use of one or more system buses (Control buses, Address Buses, Data Lines).","title":"Bus Interconnection"},{"location":"de/UnitIV/#bus-structure","text":"A system bus consists, typically, of from about 50 to hundreds of separate lines. Each line is assigned a particular meaning or function. Although there are many different bus designs, on any bus the lines can be classified into three functional groups data, address, and control lines. In addition, there may be power distribution lines that supply power to the attached modules. The data lines provide a path for moving data among system modules. These lines, collectively, are called the data bus. The data bus may consist of 32, 64, 128, or even more separate lines, the number of lines being referred to as the width of the data bus. Because each line can carry only 1 bit at a time, the number of lines determines how many bits can be transferred at a time. The width of the data bus is a key factor in determining overall system performance. For example, if the data bus is 32 bits wide and each instruction is 64 bits long, then the processor must access the memory module twice during each instruction cycle. The address lines are used to designate the source or destination of the data on the data bus. For example, if the processor wishes to read a word (8, 16, or 32 bits) of data from memory, it puts the address of the desired word on the address lines. Clearly, the width of the address bus determines the maximum possible memory capacity of the system. Furthermore, the address lines are generally also used to address I/O ports. Typically, the higher-order bits are used to select a particular module on the bus, and the lower-order bits select a memory location or I/O port within the module. For example, on an 8-bit address bus, address 01111111 and below might reference locations in a memory module (module 0) with 128 words of memory, and address 10000000 and above refer to devices attached to an I/O module (module 1). The control lines are used to control the access to and the use of the data and address lines. Because the data and address lines are shared by all components, there must be a means of controlling their use. Control signals transmit both command and timing information among system modules. Timing signals indicate the validity of data and address information. Command signals specify operations to be performed. Typical control lines include Memory write: Causes data on the bus to be written into the addressed location Memory read: Causes data from the addressed location to be placed on the bus I/O write: Causes data on the bus to be output to the addressed I/O port I/O read: Causes data from the addressed I/O port to be placed on the bus Transfer ACK: Indicates that data have been accepted from or placed on the bus Bus request: Indicates that a module needs to gain control of the bus Bus grant: Indicates that a requesting module has been granted control of the bus Interrupt request: Indicates that an interrupt is pending Interrupt ACK: Acknowledges that the pending interrupt has been recognized Clock: Is used to synchronize operations Reset: Initializes all modules The operation of the bus is as follows. If one module wishes to send data to another, it must do two things: Obtain the use of the bus, and transfer data via the bus. If one module wishes to request data from another module, it must Obtain the use of the bus, and transfer a request to the other module over the appropriate control and address lines. It must then wait for that second module to send the data. Physically, the system bus is actually a number of parallel electrical conductors. In the classic bus arrangement, these conductors are metal lines etched in a card or board (printed circuit board). The bus extends across all of the system components, each of which taps into some or all of the bus lines.","title":"Bus Structure"},{"location":"de/UnitIV/#method-of-arbitration","text":"In all but the simplest systems, more than one module may need control of the bus. For example, an I/O module may need to read or write directly to memory, without sending the data to the processor. Because only one unit at a time can successfully transmit over the bus, some method of arbitration is needed. The various methods can be roughly classified as being either centralized or distributed. In a centralized scheme, a single hardware device, referred to as a bus controller or arbiter, is responsible for allocating time on the bus. The device may be a separate module or part of the processor. In a distributed scheme, there is no central controller. Rather, each module contains access control logic and the modules act together to share the bus. With both methods of arbitration, the purpose is to designate one device, either the processor or an I/O module, as master. The master may then initiate a data transfer (e.g., read or write) with some other device, which acts as slave for this particular exchange. I/O versus Memory Bus In addition to communicating with I/O, the processor must communicate with the memory unit. Like the I/O bus, the memory bus contains data, address, and read/write control lines. There are three ways that computer buses can be used to communicate with memory and I/O: Use two separate buses, one for memory and the other for I/O. Use one common bus for both memory and I/O but have separate control lines for each. Use one common bus for memory and I/O with common control lines. In the first method, the computer has independent sets of data, address, and control buses, one for accessing memory and the other for I/O. This is done in computers that provide a separate I/O processor (IOP) in addition to the central processing unit (CPU). \"The memory communicates with both the CPU and the IOP through a memory bus. The IOP communicates also with the input and output devices through a separate I/O bus with its own address, data and control lines. The purpose of the IOP is to provide an independent pathway for the transfer of information between external devices and internal memory. The I/O processor is sometimes called a data channel.","title":"METHOD OF ARBITRATION"},{"location":"de/UnitV/","text":"Unit \u2013V Link Memory: Main, RAM, static and Dynamic, ROM, EPROM, EAROM, EEPROM, Cache and Virtual memory.

The first such machines were highly tuned conventional designs that ran faster than their more general-purpose contemporaries. Through the 1960s, they began to add increasing amounts of parallelism with one to four processors being typical. From the 1970s, the vector computing concept with specialized math units operating on large arrays of data came to dominate. A notable example is the highly successful Cray-1 of 1976. Vector computers remained the dominant design into the 1990s. From then until today, massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of off-the-shelf processors became the norm. Param Link PARAM is a series of supercomputers designed and assembled by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in Pune, India. The latest machine in the series is the PARAM ISHAN. Param means supreme in Sanskrit Language. History Link After being denied Cray supercomputers[1], India has started a program to develop indigenous supercomputers and supercomputing technologies. These supercomputers were also capable of assisting in the development of Nuclear Weapons.[4] For the purpose of achieving self-sufficiency in the field, the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) was set up in 1988 by the then Department of Electronics with Dr. Vijay Bhatkar as its Director.[1] The project was given an initial run of 3 years and an initial funding of \u20b9 300,000,000, the same amount of money and time that was usually expended to purchase a supercomputer from the US.[1] In 1990, a prototype was produced and was benchmarked at the 1990 Zurich Supercomputering Show. It surpassed most other systems, placing India second after US. The final result of the effort was the PARAM 8000, which was installed in 1991.

Transputers were a fairly new and innovative microprocessor architecture designed for parallel processing at the time. It was a distributed memory MIMD architecture with a reconfigurable interconnection network.[8] It had 64 CPUs. Exported to Germany, UK and Russia.[9] PARAM 8600 Link PARAM 8600 was an improvement over PARAM 8000. It was a 256 CPU computer. For every four Inmos T800, it employed an Intel i860 coprocessor.[8] The result was over 5 GFLOPS at peak for vector processing. Several of these models were exported. PARAM 9900/SS Link PARAM 9900/SS was designed to be a MPP system. It used the SuperSPARC II processor. The design was changed to be modular so that newer processors could be easily accommodated. Typically, it used 32-40 processors. But, it could be scaled up to 200 CPUs using the clos network topology.[8] PARAM 9900/US was the UltraSPARC variant and PARAM 9900/AA was the DEC Alpha variant. PARAM 10000 Link In 1998, the PARAM 10000 was unveiled. PARAM 10000 used several independent nodes, each based on the Sun Enterprise 250 server and each such server contained two 400Mhz UltraSPARC II processors. The base configuration had three compute nodes and a server node. The peak speed of this base system was 6.4 GFLOPS.[10] A typical system would contain 160 CPUs and be capable of 100 GFLOPS[11] But, it was easily scalable to the TFLOP range. Exported to Russia and Singapore.[12] PARAM Padma Link PARAM Padma (Padma means Lotus in Sanskrit) was introduced in April 2003.[3] It had a peak speed of 1024 GFLOPS (about 1 TFLOP) and a peak storage of 1 TB. It used 248 IBM Power4 CPUs of 1 GHz each. The operating system was IBM AIX 5.1L. It used PARAMnet II as its primary interconnect.[11] It was the first Indian supercomputer to break the 1 TFLOP barrier.[13] PARAM Yuva Link PARAM Yuva (Yuva means Youth in Sanskrit) was unveiled in November 2008. It has a maximum sustainable speed (Rmax) of 38.1 TFLOPS and a peak speed (Rpeak) of 54 TFLOPS.[14] There are 4608 cores in it, based on Intel 73XX of 2.9 GHz each. It has a storage capacity of 25 TB up to 200 TB.[15] It uses PARAMnet 3 as its primary interconnect.[13] Further developments Link In July 2009, it was announced that C-DAC was developing a new high-speed PARAM. It was expected to be unveiled by 2012 and was expected to break the 1 PetaFLOPS barrier.[16] In November 2014 it was reported that India is working on the Fastest supercomputer ever which is set to work at 132 Exaflops per second.[17] Param Yuva II Link Param Yuva II was made by Centre for Development of Advanced Computing in a period of three months, at a cost of \u20b916 crore (US$3 million), and was unveiled on 8 February 2013. It performs at a peak of 524 teraflops and consumes 35% less energy as compared to Param Yuva. It delivers sustained performance of 360.8 teraflops on the community standard Linpack benchmark, and would have been ranked 62 in the November 2012 ranking list of Top500. In terms of power efficiency, it would have been ranked 33 rd in the November 2012 List of Top Green500 supercomputers of the world.[18][19] It is the first Indian supercomputer achieving more than 500 teraflops.[20][21] Param Yuva II will be used for research in space, bioinformatics, weather forecasting, seismic data analysis, aeronautical engineering, scientific data processing and pharmaceutical development. Educational institutes like the Indian Institutes of Technology and National Institutes of Technology can be linked to the computer through the national knowledge network. This computer is a stepping stone towards building the future petaflop-range supercomputers in India. PARAMNet Link PARAMNet is a high speed high bandwidth low latency network developed for the PARAM series. The original PARAMNet used an 8 port cascadable non-blocking switch developed by C-DAC. Each port provided 400 Mb/s in both directions (thus 2x400 Mbit/s) as it was a full-duplex network. It was first used in PARAM 10000.[5] PARAMNet II Link PARAMNet II, introduced with PARAM Padma, is capable of 2.5 Gb/s while working full-duplex. It supports interfaces like Virtual Interface Architecture and Active messages. It uses 8 or 16 port SAN switches. The grid computing network GARUDA is also based on it. Operators Link PARAM supercomputers are used by both public and private operators for various purposes. As of 2008, 52 PARAMs have been deployed. Of these, 8 are located in Russia, Singapore, Germany and Canada.[13] PARAMs have also been sold to Tanzania, Armenia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Ghana, Myanmar, Nepal, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.

List out the areas in which data structure are applied extensively. [8] Answer : A data structure is basically a group of data elements that are put together under one name, and which defines a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures are used in almost every program or software system. Some common examples of data structures are arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, binary trees, and hash tables. Data structures are building blocks of a program. A program built using improper data structures may not work as expected. So as a programmer it is mandatory to choose most appropriate data structures for a program. The term data means a value or set of values. It specifies either the value of a variable or a constant (e.g., marks of students, name of an employee, address of a customer, value of pi, etc.). A record is a collection of data items. For example, the name, address, course, and marks obtained are individual data items. But all these data items can be grouped together to form a record. Data structures are generally categorized into two classes: primitive and non-primitive data structures. Primitive and Non-primitive Data Structures Primitive data structures are the fundamental data types which are supported by a programming language. Some basic data types are integer, real, character, and boolean. The terms \u2018data type\u2019, \u2018basic data type\u2019, and \u2018primitive data type\u2019 are often used interchangeably. Non-primitive data structures are those data structures which are created using primitive data structures. Examples of such data structures include linked lists, stacks, trees, and graphs. Non-primitive data structures can further be classified into two categories: linear and non-linear data structures. Linear Data Structure: If the elements of a data structure are stored in a linear or sequential order, then it is a linear data structure. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Linear data structures can be represented in memory in two different ways. One way is to have to a linear relationship between elements by means of sequential memory locations. The other way is to have a linear relationship between elements by means of links. Non Linear Data Structure: if the elements of a data structure are not stored in a sequential order, then it is a non-linear data structure. The relationship of adjacency is not maintained between elements of a non-linear data structure. Examples include trees and graphs. Data structures are widely applied in the following areas: Compiler design , Operating system, Statistical analysis, package, DBMS, Numerical analysis, Simulation, Artificial intelligence, Graphics. 1. Explain the various aspects of problem solving in detail. Also, discuss pros and cons of each. [7] Answer: Solve Following What is an algorithm?

What are the types of data structure? List out the areas in which data structure are applied extensively. [8] Answer : A data structure is basically a group of data elements that are put together under one name, and which defines a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures are used in almost every program or software system. Some common examples of data structures are arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, binary trees, and hash tables. Data structures are building blocks of a program. A program built using improper data structures may not work as expected. So as a programmer it is mandatory to choose most appropriate data structures for a program. The term data means a value or set of values. It specifies either the value of a variable or a constant (e.g., marks of students, name of an employee, address of a customer, value of pi, etc.). A record is a collection of data items. For example, the name, address, course, and marks obtained are individual data items. But all these data items can be grouped together to form a record. Data structures are generally categorized into two classes: primitive and non-primitive data structures. Primitive and Non-primitive Data Structures Primitive data structures are the fundamental data types which are supported by a programming language. Some basic data types are integer, real, character, and boolean. The terms \u2018data type\u2019, \u2018basic data type\u2019, and \u2018primitive data type\u2019 are often used interchangeably. Non-primitive data structures are those data structures which are created using primitive data structures. Examples of such data structures include linked lists, stacks, trees, and graphs. Non-primitive data structures can further be classified into two categories: linear and non-linear data structures. Linear Data Structure: If the elements of a data structure are stored in a linear or sequential order, then it is a linear data structure. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Linear data structures can be represented in memory in two different ways. One way is to have to a linear relationship between elements by means of sequential memory locations. The other way is to have a linear relationship between elements by means of links. Non Linear Data Structure: if the elements of a data structure are not stored in a sequential order, then it is a non-linear data structure. The relationship of adjacency is not maintained between elements of a non-linear data structure. Examples include trees and graphs. Data structures are widely applied in the following areas: Compiler design , Operating system, Statistical analysis, package, DBMS, Numerical analysis, Simulation, Artificial intelligence, Graphics. 1.

For every data object, we consider the class of operations to be performed and then the way to represent the object so that these operations may be efficiently carried out. We require two techniques for this: Devise alternative forms of data representation Analyze the algorithm which operates on the structure. Variable Link Data Link Program Link Programming Language Link Interactions involving humans are most effectively carried out through the medium of language. Language permits the expression of thoughts and ideas, and without it, communication as we know it would be very difficult indeed. In computer programming, a programming language serves as a means of communication between the person with a problem and the computer used to help solve it. An effective programming language enhances both the development and the expression of computer programs. It must bridge the gap between the often unstructured nature of human thought and the precision required for computer execution. A hierarchy of programming languages based on increasing machine independence includes the following: Machine-level languages Assembly languages Higher-level or user-oriented languages Problem-oriented languages A machine-level language is the lowest form of computer language. Each instruction in a program is represented by a numeric code, and numerical addresses are used throughout the program to refer to memory locations in the computer's memory. All bookkeeping aspects of the program are the sole responsibility of the machine-language programmer. Finally, all diagnostics and programming aids must be supplied by the programmer. Also included as machine-level programs are programs written in microcode (i.e., microprograms). Microcode allows for the expression of some of the more powerful machine-level instructions in terms of a set of basic machine instructions. Assembly language is essentially a symbolic version of a machine-level language. Each operation code is given a symbolic code such as ADD for addition and MUL for multiplication. Moreover, memory locations are given symbolic names such as PAY and RATE. Some assembly languages contain macroinstructions which are at a higher level than assembly-languages instructions. Assembly- language systems offer certain diagnostic and debugging assistance that is normally not available at the machine level. A high-level language such as FORTRAN, PASCAL, or PL/I offers most of the features of an assembly language. While some facilities for accessing system- level features may not be provided, a high-level language offers a more enriched set of language features such as structured control constructs, nested statements, blocks, and procedures. A problem-oriented language provides for the expression of problems in a specific application or problem area. Examples of such languages are SEQUEL for database retrieval applications and COGO for civil engineering applications. Advantages of high-level languages over low-level languages such as machine and assembly languages include the following: High-level languages are easier to learn than their lower-level counterparts. The learning of many high-level languages requires little or no computer hardware background because such languages are relatively machine-independent. Furthermore, these languages are closer to their problem areas than lower-level languages. The programmer does not have to be concerned with clerical tasks involving numerical or symbolic references to instructions, memory locations, constants, etc. Such tasks are handled by a system which translates the high-level language program into machine language. A programmer is not required to know how to convert data from external forms to various internal forms within the memory of a computer. The ability of a programmer to convert, say, numeric data into internal forms such as floating-point numbers and packed-decimal numbers should be irrelevant. Most high-level languages offer a programmer a variety of control structures which are not available in low-level languages. High-level languages offer several of the following language constructs: Conditional statements (such as IF-THEN-ELSE and CASE statements) Looping statements (for both counted and conditional loops) Nested statements Block structures These control structures improve programming style and facilitate certain programming approaches such as structured programming. Resulting programs are easier to read, understand, and alter. This results in reduced programming costs because programs are less complicated. Programs written in a high-level language are usually more easily debugged than their machine- or assembly-language equivalents. High-level languages offer constructs that eliminate or reduce certain kinds of programming errors that occur in low-level languages. For example, the declaration of variables in a program adds a certain degree of redundancy which is useful in detecting errors in the improper use of variables. Languages often enforce a disciplined use of pointers. Moreover, a structured program is much more easily debugged than its unstructured counterpart. Since most high-level languages offer more powerful control and data-structuring capabilities than low-level languages, the former class of languages facilitates the expression of a solution to a particular problem. Because of the availability of certain language features such as procedures, high-level languages permit a modular and hierarchical description of programming tasks. These tasks can then be assigned to a team of programmers, thus facilitating a division of labor with a minimum of disruption and effort. Such an approach permits better documentation of a problem. Also, increased compatibility among programs and programmers can be realized. Finally, high-level languages are relatively machine-independent. Consequently, certain programs such as FORTRAN and COBOL programs are portable. These programs can be executed on different computers with little, if any, change even though these computers have different internal architectures and machine-language instruction sets. Program portability reduces costs and, in general, protects an installation against computer obsolescence. Often when a computer is replaced, all associated assembly- and machine-language programs become obsolete. structure and problem solving Link Data Structure Link Introduction to Data Structure Link The way information is organized in the memory of a computer is called a data structure A data structure is a way of organizing data that considers not only the items stored, but also their relationship to each other. Advance knowledge about the relationship between data items allows designing of efficient algorithms for the manipulation of data. Many algorithms require that we use a proper representation of data to achieve efficiency. This representation and the operations that are allowed for it are called data structures. Each data structure allows insertion, access, deletion etc. Why do we need data structures? Data structures allow us to achieve an important goal: component reuse Once each data structure has been implemented once, it can be used over and over again in various applications. Common data structures are Stacks, Queues, Lists, Trees, Graphs, Tables etc. Types of Data Structure/Classification of Data Structure Link Based on how the data items or operated it will classified into Primitive Data Structure : is one the data items are operated closest to the machine level instruction. Eg : int, char and double. Non-Primitive Data Structure : is one that data items are not operated closest to machine level instruction. Linear Data Structure : In which the data items are stored in sequence order. Eg: Arrays, Lists, Stacks and Queues. Linear Data Structures List Array One Dimensional Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Array Matrix Sparse Matrix Linked List Single Linked List Double Linked List Circular Linked List Ordered List Stack Queue Circular Queue Priority Queue Deque Dictionary (Associative Array) Hash Table Operations performed on any linear structure: Traversal \u2013 Processing each element in the list Search \u2013 Finding the location of the element with a given value. Insertion \u2013 Adding a new element to the list. Deletion \u2013 Removing an element from the list. Sorting \u2013 Arranging the elements in some type of order. Merging \u2013 Combining two lists into a single list. Non Linear Data Structure : In which the order of data items is not presence. Eg : Trees, Graphs.

Parse Tree Algorithms Link Introduction to Algorithm Link Sub Algorithms Link A sub algorithm is an independent component of an algorithm often broken down into smaller chunks and for this reason is defined separately from the main algorithm. The purpose of a sub algorithm is to perform some computation when required, under control of the main algorithm. This computation may be performed on zero or more parameters passed by the calling routine. So that they are easy to read, reuse in another algorithm When the problem is very complex, it is divided into several independent sub-problems. Each sub-problem is called sub-algorithm and can be developed independently. These sub-problems can be combined together to form the solution for the entire problem. Thus by using sub-algorithms the complex problems can be solved easily. A sub-algorithm is a block of instructions that is executed when it is called from some other point of the algorithm. Sub-algorithms are of two type: Sub-algorithms that do not return a value Sub-algorithms that return a value The sub-algorithm is called function in C++. Definition of a sub-algorithm that does not return a value Sub-algorithm without arguments: SUBALGORITHM subalgorithm-name ( ) Statements END subalgorithm-name where, ( ) is the empty list. Sub-algorithm with arguments: SUBALGORITHM subalgorithm-name (parameter-list) Statements END subalgorithm-name where, Parameter-list is a list that contains one or more parameters that are passed to the sub-algorithm. Note: The call to a sub-algorithm that does not return a value is given in the CALL statement which has the following syntax: subalgorithm-name (Actual parameters) e.g. sum(4,7) or sum(x,y) Definition of a sub-algorithm that returns a value: Sub-algorithm without arguments: ftype SUBALGORITHM subalgorithm-name ( ) Statements END subalgorithm-name Notes: ftype: is any data type that the result of a subalgortihm can have. If the subalgorithm does not return any result, then no type is specified. ( ) empty list. If the subalgorithm has a type, then the Statements in the body of the subalgorithm should have return statement, usually it is the last statement. Sub-algorithm without arguments: ftype SUBALGORITHM subalgorithm-name (parameter-list) Statements END subalgorithm-name Notes: ftype: is any data type that the result of a Subalgorithm can have. If the Subalgorithm does not return any result, then no type is specified. parameter-list: includes one or more arguments. If the Subalgorithm has a type, then the Statements in the body of the Subalgorithm should have return statement, usually it is the last statement. DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO DESIGNING AN ALGORITHM Link Algorithms are used to manipulate the data contained in data structures. When working with data structures, algorithms are used to perform operations on the stored data. A complex algorithm is often divided into smaller units called modules. This process of dividing an algorithm into modules is called modularization. The key advantages of modularization are as follows: complex algorithm simpler to design and implement. Each module can be designed independently. While designing one module, the details of other modules can be ignored, thereby enhancing clarity in design which in turn simplifies implementation, debugging, testing, documenting, and maintenance of the overall algorithm. There are two main approaches to design an algorithm\u2014top-down approach and bottom-up approach, as shown in Fig. Top-down approach Link A top-down design approach starts by dividing the complex algorithm into one or more modules. These modules can further be decomposed into one or more sub-modules, and this process of decomposition is iterated until the desired level of module complexity is achieved. Top-down design method is a form of stepwise refinement where we begin with the topmost module and incrementally add modules that it calls. Therefore, in a top-down approach, we start from an abstract design and then at each step, this design is refined into more concrete levels until a level is reached that requires no further refinement. Bottom-up approach Link A bottom-up approach is just the reverse of top-down approach. In the bottom-up design, we start with designing the most basic or concrete modules and then proceed towards designing higher level modules. The higher level modules are implemented by using the operations performed by lower level modules. Thus, in this approach sub-modules are grouped together to form a higher level module. All the higher level modules are clubbed together to form even higher level modules. This process is repeated until the design of the complete algorithm is obtained. STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING Link It is a programming style; and this style of programming is known by several names: Procedural decomposition, Structured programming, etc. Structured programming is not programming with structures but by using following types of code structures to write programs: Sequence of sequentially executed statements Conditional execution of statements (i.e., \u201cif\u201d statements) Looping or iteration (i.e., \u201cfor, do...while, and while\u201d statements) Structured subroutine calls (i.e., functions) In particular, the following language usage is forbidden: \u201cGoTo\u201d statements \u201cBreak\u201d or \u201ccontinue\u201d out of the middle of loops Multiple exit points to a function/ procedure/ subroutine (i.e., multiple \u201creturn\u201d statements) Multiple entry points to a function/ procedure/ subroutine/ method In this style of programming there is a great risk that implementation details of many data structures have to be shared between functions, and thus globally exposed. This in turn tempts other functions to use these implementation details; thereby creating unwanted dependencies between different parts of the program. The main disadvantage is that all decisions made from the start of the project depends directly or indirectly on the high-level specification of the application. It is a well- known fact that this specification tends to change over a time. When that happens, there is a great risk that large parts of the application need to be rewritten. Top-down vs bottom-up approach Link Whether the top-down strategy should be followed or a bottom-up is a question that can be answered depending on the application at hand. While top-down approach follows a stepwise refinement by decomposing the algorithm into manageable modules, the bottom-up approach on the other hand defines a module and then groups together several modules to form a new higher level module. Top-down approach is highly appreciated for ease in documenting the modules, generation of test cases, implementation of code, and debugging. However, it is also criticized because the sub-modules are analysed in isolation without concentrating on their communication with other modules or on reusability of components and little attention is paid to data, thereby ignoring the concept of information hiding. Although the bottom-up approach allows information hiding as it first identifies what has to be encapsulated within a module and then provides an abstract interface to define the module\u2019s boundaries as seen from the clients. But all this is difficult to be done in a strict bottom-up strategy. Some top-down activities need to be performed for this. All in all, design of complex algorithms must not be constrained to proceed according to a fixed pattern but should be a blend of top-down and bottom-up approaches. Algorithmic Notation Link Big Oh Link Big Omega Link Big Theta Link Algorithm Analysis Link introduction to algorithm analysis Link After designing an algorithm, it has to be checked and its correctness needs to be predicted; this is done by analyzing the algorithm. The algorithm can be analyzed by tracing all step-by-step instructions, reading the algorithm for logical correctness, and testing it on some data using mathematical techniques to prove it correct. Another type of analysis is to analyze the simplicity of the algorithm. That is, design the algorithm in a simple way so that it becomes easier to be implemented. However, the simplest and most straightforward way of solving a problem may not be sometimes the best one. Moreover there may be more than one algorithm to solve a problem. The choice of a particular algorithm depends on following performance analysis and measurements : Space complexity Time complexity Complexity Link Time Complexity Link The time complexity of an algorithm or a program is the amount of time it needs to run to completion. The exact time will depend on the implementation of the algorithm, programming language, optimizing the capabilities of the compiler used, the CPU speed, other hardware characteristics/ specifications and so on. To measure the time complexity accurately, we have to count all sorts of operations performed in an algorithm. If we know the time for each one of the primitive operations performed in a given computer, we can easily compute the time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution. This time will vary from machine to machine. By analyzing an algorithm, it is hard to come out with an exact time required. To find out exact time complexity, we need to know the exact instruc- tions executed by the hardware and the time required for the instruction. The time com- plexity also depends on the amount of data inputted to an algorithm. But we can calculate the order of magnitude for the time required. That is, our intention is to estimate the execution time of an algorithm irrespective of the computer machine on which it will be used. Here, the more sophisticated method is to identify the key operations and count such operations performed till the program com- pletes its execution. A key operation in our algorithm is an operation that takes maximum time among all possible operations in the algorithm. Such an abstract, theoretical ap- proach is not only useful for discussing and comparing algorithms, but also it is useful to improve solutions to practical problems. The time complexity can now be expressed as function of number of key operations performed. Before we go ahead with our discussions, it is important to understand the rate growth analysis of an algorithm, as shown in Fig Space complexity Link Analysis of space complexity of an algorithm or program is the amount of memory it needs to run to completion. Some of the reasons for studying space complexity are: If the program is to run on multi user system, it may be required to specify the amount of memory to be allocated to the program. We may be interested to know in advance that whether sufficient memory is available to run the program. There may be several possible solutions with different space requirements. Can be used to estimate the size of the largest problem that a program can solve. The space needed by a program consists of following components. Instruction space : Space needed to store the executable version of the program and it is fixed. Data space : Space needed to store all constants, variable values and has further two components : Space needed by constants and simple variables. This space is fixed. Space needed by fixed sized structural variables, such as arrays and structures. Dynamically allocated space. This space usually varies. Environment stack space: This space is needed to store the information to resume the suspended (partially completed) functions. Each time a function is invoked the following data is saved on the environment stack : Return address : i.e., from where it has to resume after completion of the called function. Values of all lead variables and the values of formal parameters in the function being invoked . The amount of space needed by recursive function is called the recursion stack space. For each recursive function, this space depends on the space needed by the local variables and the formal parameter. In addition, this space depends on the maximum depth of the recursion i.e., maximum number of nested recursive calls. Goals And Design Philosophies of Programming Language Link When a programming language is designed, particular attention must be given to the goals of the language. A number of important goals, such as human communication, the prevention and detection of errors, usability, program effectiveness, compatibility, efficiency, machine independence, and simplicity, are described in turn. This section is also concerned with design philosophies. Philosophies such as uniformity, orthogonality, generality, language modularity, minimality, and level of abstraction are discussed. Human Communication While it is important to communicate efficiently with the computer, detect errors well, and so on, the most basic goal of a programming language is communication between human beings. If a program cannot be understood by humans, it is difficult to verify and it cannot be maintained or modified. Even if the program is still clear to its author, this is a strictly temporary condition. It has been suggested by Kernighan and Plauger (1976) that readability is the best single index of good programming. Certainly, one of the crucial factors in achieving readable programs is an understandable programming language. It is important to realize that the problems of human communication cannot be left entirely to comments or external documentation. Programmers dislike writing excessive comments and tend to avoid them. External documentation is all too often out-of-date and incomplete. Also, this can sometimes apply to internal documentation. A good and very reliable form of documentation is the program itself\u2014if it is readable. Programming languages must be designed with constant attention to clarity and understandability. It is vital to distinguish between readability and writability. It is important to be able to write programs easily. It is necessary to be able to read programs easily. The readability of programs is far more important in the long run than their writability (Hoare, 1973). This is of particular significance because many \"powerful\" and \"convenient\" features tend to produce monumentally obscure programs (e.g., APL \"one-liners\"). The most basic implication of the readability problem for the design of programming languages is that the syntax must reflect the semantics. If the syntax of the programming language does not accurately and completely reflect the manipulations being carried out, there is little hope for understanding the program. Making the syntax match the semantics implies several things. The syntax must clearly state what is happening in sufficient detail to be understandable but not in such unnecessary detail as to be overwhelming. Care should be taken to ensure that a construct performing a particular operation does not read as if it were doing something similar but not quite the same. Furthermore, it is most undesirable for significant actions to be undertaken without any indication in the syntax whatsoever. This rule may seem obvious, but a considerable number of languages violate it (notably PL/I with its conversions and ON-units, and ALGOL 68 with its coercions). A most unfortunate choice of terminology in the field of computer science is the term syntactic sugar because it implies that making language constructs understandable is an unnecessary frill. It is vital that the syntax of a programming language should reflect human thought patterns, rather than the more \"elegant\" but much more obscure patterns of, for example, the lambda calculus (Church, 1941) (or, still worse, the peculiarities of a particular computer's instruction set). A final facet that must be mentioned with regard to human communication through programming languages is that programmers are not computers. Just because a compiler can understand a given construct there is no guarantee that a programmer can. The limitations of the human mind make it quite easy for a complicated structure to become unmanageable, while the compiler has no problem. For example, a simple stack algorithm handles nested constructs for a compiler. Human beings, however, probably do not function in a stacklike manner, and deeply nested constructs can very easily become completely incomprehensible. Humans are ill-equipped to cope with situations where the effect of a construct depends in a complex way on context (as can arise through the use of PL/I ON units). It is also quite possible for a construct to be ambiguous to a human while it is clear and obvious to a compiler (Weinberg, 1971). A good example of this is the simple arithmetic expression \"a/b/c\". In general, a parser will not consider this ambiguous, but how many human programmers would write it without using parentheses? Although it may be more time consuming for a compiler to disallow such a construct, the protection can be worth it. **Prevention and Detection of Errors ** It is a recognized fact that programmers make errors. Although much current work in the field of software engineering is directed toward stopping errors at the source (the programmer), there is no foreseeable chance that errors will be eliminated entirely. It is therefore necessary to assist the programmer in the task of not only preventing but also detecting, identifying, and correcting errors. A good programming language can be a major factor in this. In fact, the efforts of Lampson et al. (1977) in the design of EUCLID, a PASCAL-based language intended for the expression of system programs which are to be verified, indicates that a programming language can significantly affect the ease with which a Unit-II Primitive and non-primitive data structure concept, representation and manipulation of strings, concept and terminology for non-primitive data structure, concept of arrays, stacks, and queues. Basic operations on arrays, stacks & queues. By Vinod: Data Data Type Data Structure Types of Data Structure Linear and Non Linear Primitive and Non-Primitive Concepts Terminology Arrays and its Operations Stack and its Operations Queue and its Operations Strings Representation Manipulation These are several terms involved above which we need to know carefully before we proceed. These include data structure, data type and data representation. Data Type: A data type is a classification of data, which can store a specific type of information. Data types are primarily used in computer programming, in which variables are created to store data. Each variable is assigned a data type that determines what type of data the variable may contain. A data type is a term which refers to the kinds of data that variables may hold. With every programming language there is a set of built-in data types. This means that the language allows variables to name data of that type and provides a set of operations which meaningfully manipulates these variables. Some data types are easy to provide because they are built-in into the computer\u2019s machine language instruction set, such as integer, character etc. Other data types require considerably more efficient to implement. In some languages, these are features which allow one to construct combinations of the built-in types ( like structures in \u2018C\u2019). However, it is necessary to have such mechanism to create the new complex data types which are not provided by the programming language. The new type also must be meaningful for manipulations. Such meaningful data types are referred as abstract data type. Definition of Data Structure Primitive data type: The data structures, typically those data structure that are directly operated upon by machine level instructions i.e. the fundamental data types such as int, float, double in case of \u2018c\u2019 are known as primitive data structures. The term \"data type\" and \"primitive data type\" are often used interchangeably. Primitive data types are predefined types of data, which are supported by the programming language. For example, integer, character, and string are all primitive data types. Programmers can use these data types when creating variables in their programs. For example, a programmer may create a variable called \"lastname\" and define it as a string data type. The variable will then store data as a string of characters. Integer: This is used to represent a number without decimal point. Eg: 12, 90 Float and Double: This is used to represent a number with decimal point. Eg: 45.1, 67.3 Character : This is used to represent single character Eg: \u2018C\u2019, \u2018a\u2019 String: This is used to represent group of characters. Eg: \"M.S.P.V.L Polytechnic College\" Boolean: This is used represent logical values either true or false. Non-primitive data types are not defined by the programming language, but are instead created by the programmer. They are sometimes called \"reference variables,\" or \"object references,\" since they reference a memory location, which stores the data. In the Java programming language, non-primitive data types are simply called \"objects\" because they are created, rather than predefined. While an object may contain any type of data, the information referenced by the object may still be stored as a primitive data type. The data structures, which are not primitive are called non-primitive data structures. There are two types of non-primitive data structures. Linear Data Structures:- A list, which shows the relationship of adjacency between elements, is said to be linear data structure. The most, simplest linear data structure is a 1-D array, but because of its deficiency, list is frequently used for different kinds of data. Non-linear data structure:-A list, which doesn\u2019t show the relationship of adjacency between elements, is said to be non-linear data structure.

Language permits the expression of thoughts and ideas, and without it, communication as we know it would be very difficult indeed. In computer programming, a programming language serves as a means of communication between the person with a problem and the computer used to help solve it. An effective programming language enhances both the development and the expression of computer programs. It must bridge the gap between the often unstructured nature of human thought and the precision required for computer execution. A hierarchy of programming languages based on increasing machine independence includes the following: Machine-level languages Assembly languages Higher-level or user-oriented languages Problem-oriented languages A machine-level language is the lowest form of computer language. Each instruction in a program is represented by a numeric code, and numerical addresses are used throughout the program to refer to memory locations in the computer's memory. All bookkeeping aspects of the program are the sole responsibility of the machine-language programmer. Finally, all diagnostics and programming aids must be supplied by the programmer. Also included as machine-level programs are programs written in microcode (i.e., microprograms). Microcode allows for the expression of some of the more powerful machine-level instructions in terms of a set of basic machine instructions. Assembly language is essentially a symbolic version of a machine-level language. Each operation code is given a symbolic code such as ADD for addition and MUL for multiplication. Moreover, memory locations are given symbolic names such as PAY and RATE. Some assembly languages contain macroinstructions which are at a higher level than assembly-languages instructions. Assembly- language systems offer certain diagnostic and debugging assistance that is normally not available at the machine level. A high-level language such as FORTRAN, PASCAL, or PL/I offers most of the features of an assembly language. While some facilities for accessing system- level features may not be provided, a high-level language offers a more enriched set of language features such as structured control constructs, nested statements, blocks, and procedures. A problem-oriented language provides for the expression of problems in a specific application or problem area. Examples of such languages are SEQUEL for database retrieval applications and COGO for civil engineering applications. Advantages of high-level languages over low-level languages such as machine and assembly languages include the following: High-level languages are easier to learn than their lower-level counterparts. The learning of many high-level languages requires little or no computer hardware background because such languages are relatively machine-independent. Furthermore, these languages are closer to their problem areas than lower-level languages. The programmer does not have to be concerned with clerical tasks involving numerical or symbolic references to instructions, memory locations, constants, etc. Such tasks are handled by a system which translates the high-level language program into machine language. A programmer is not required to know how to convert data from external forms to various internal forms within the memory of a computer. The ability of a programmer to convert, say, numeric data into internal forms such as floating-point numbers and packed-decimal numbers should be irrelevant. Most high-level languages offer a programmer a variety of control structures which are not available in low-level languages. High-level languages offer several of the following language constructs: Conditional statements (such as IF-THEN-ELSE and CASE statements) Looping statements (for both counted and conditional loops) Nested statements Block structures These control structures improve programming style and facilitate certain programming approaches such as structured programming. Resulting programs are easier to read, understand, and alter. This results in reduced programming costs because programs are less complicated. Programs written in a high-level language are usually more easily debugged than their machine- or assembly-language equivalents. High-level languages offer constructs that eliminate or reduce certain kinds of programming errors that occur in low-level languages. For example, the declaration of variables in a program adds a certain degree of redundancy which is useful in detecting errors in the improper use of variables. Languages often enforce a disciplined use of pointers. Moreover, a structured program is much more easily debugged than its unstructured counterpart. Since most high-level languages offer more powerful control and data-structuring capabilities than low-level languages, the former class of languages facilitates the expression of a solution to a particular problem. Because of the availability of certain language features such as procedures, high-level languages permit a modular and hierarchical description of programming tasks. These tasks can then be assigned to a team of programmers, thus facilitating a division of labor with a minimum of disruption and effort. Such an approach permits better documentation of a problem. Also, increased compatibility among programs and programmers can be realized. Finally, high-level languages are relatively machine-independent. Consequently, certain programs such as FORTRAN and COBOL programs are portable. These programs can be executed on different computers with little, if any, change even though these computers have different internal architectures and machine-language instruction sets. Program portability reduces costs and, in general, protects an installation against computer obsolescence. Often when a computer is replaced, all associated assembly- and machine-language programs become obsolete.","title":"Programming Language"},{"location":"dsa/Unit%20I/#structure-and-problem-solving","text":"","title":"structure and problem solving"},{"location":"dsa/Unit%20I/#data-structure","text":"","title":"Data Structure"},{"location":"dsa/Unit%20I/#introduction-to-data-structure","text":"The way information is organized in the memory of a computer is called a data structure A data structure is a way of organizing data that considers not only the items stored, but also their relationship to each other.

Each time a function is invoked the following data is saved on the environment stack : Return address : i.e., from where it has to resume after completion of the called function. Values of all lead variables and the values of formal parameters in the function being invoked . The amount of space needed by recursive function is called the recursion stack space. For each recursive function, this space depends on the space needed by the local variables and the formal parameter. In addition, this space depends on the maximum depth of the recursion i.e., maximum number of nested recursive calls.","title":"Space complexity"},{"location":"dsa/Unit%20I/#goals-and-design-philosophies-of-programming-language","text":"When a programming language is designed, particular attention must be given to the goals of the language. A number of important goals, such as human communication, the prevention and detection of errors, usability, program effectiveness, compatibility, efficiency, machine independence, and simplicity, are described in turn. This section is also concerned with design philosophies. Philosophies such as uniformity, orthogonality, generality, language modularity, minimality, and level of abstraction are discussed. Human Communication While it is important to communicate efficiently with the computer, detect errors well, and so on, the most basic goal of a programming language is communication between human beings. If a program cannot be understood by humans, it is difficult to verify and it cannot be maintained or modified. Even if the program is still clear to its author, this is a strictly temporary condition. It has been suggested by Kernighan and Plauger (1976) that readability is the best single index of good programming. Certainly, one of the crucial factors in achieving readable programs is an understandable programming language. It is important to realize that the problems of human communication cannot be left entirely to comments or external documentation. Programmers dislike writing excessive comments and tend to avoid them. External documentation is all too often out-of-date and incomplete. Also, this can sometimes apply to internal documentation. A good and very reliable form of documentation is the program itself\u2014if it is readable. Programming languages must be designed with constant attention to clarity and understandability. It is vital to distinguish between readability and writability. It is important to be able to write programs easily. It is necessary to be able to read programs easily. The readability of programs is far more important in the long run than their writability (Hoare, 1973). This is of particular significance because many \"powerful\" and \"convenient\" features tend to produce monumentally obscure programs (e.g., APL \"one-liners\"). The most basic implication of the readability problem for the design of programming languages is that the syntax must reflect the semantics. If the syntax of the programming language does not accurately and completely reflect the manipulations being carried out, there is little hope for understanding the program. Making the syntax match the semantics implies several things. The syntax must clearly state what is happening in sufficient detail to be understandable but not in such unnecessary detail as to be overwhelming. Care should be taken to ensure that a construct performing a particular operation does not read as if it were doing something similar but not quite the same. Furthermore, it is most undesirable for significant actions to be undertaken without any indication in the syntax whatsoever. This rule may seem obvious, but a considerable number of languages violate it (notably PL/I with its conversions and ON-units, and ALGOL 68 with its coercions). A most unfortunate choice of terminology in the field of computer science is the term syntactic sugar because it implies that making language constructs understandable is an unnecessary frill. It is vital that the syntax of a programming language should reflect human thought patterns, rather than the more \"elegant\" but much more obscure patterns of, for example, the lambda calculus (Church, 1941) (or, still worse, the peculiarities of a particular computer's instruction set). A final facet that must be mentioned with regard to human communication through programming languages is that programmers are not computers. Just because a compiler can understand a given construct there is no guarantee that a programmer can. The limitations of the human mind make it quite easy for a complicated structure to become unmanageable, while the compiler has no problem. For example, a simple stack algorithm handles nested constructs for a compiler. Human beings, however, probably do not function in a stacklike manner, and deeply nested constructs can very easily become completely incomprehensible. Humans are ill-equipped to cope with situations where the effect of a construct depends in a complex way on context (as can arise through the use of PL/I ON units). It is also quite possible for a construct to be ambiguous to a human while it is clear and obvious to a compiler (Weinberg, 1971). A good example of this is the simple arithmetic expression \"a/b/c\". In general, a parser will not consider this ambiguous, but how many human programmers would write it without using parentheses? Although it may be more time consuming for a compiler to disallow such a construct, the protection can be worth it. **Prevention and Detection of Errors ** It is a recognized fact that programmers make errors. Although much current work in the field of software engineering is directed toward stopping errors at the source (the programmer), there is no foreseeable chance that errors will be eliminated entirely. It is therefore necessary to assist the programmer in the task of not only preventing but also detecting, identifying, and correcting errors. A good programming language can be a major factor in this. In fact, the efforts of Lampson et al. (1977) in the design of EUCLID, a PASCAL-based language intended for the expression of system programs which are to be verified, indicates that a programming language can significantly affect the ease with which a Unit-II Primitive and non-primitive data structure concept, representation and manipulation of strings, concept and terminology for non-primitive data structure, concept of arrays, stacks, and queues. Basic operations on arrays, stacks & queues. By Vinod: Data Data Type Data Structure Types of Data Structure Linear and Non Linear Primitive and Non-Primitive Concepts Terminology Arrays and its Operations Stack and its Operations Queue and its Operations Strings Representation Manipulation These are several terms involved above which we need to know carefully before we proceed. These include data structure, data type and data representation. Data Type: A data type is a classification of data, which can store a specific type of information. Data types are primarily used in computer programming, in which variables are created to store data. Each variable is assigned a data type that determines what type of data the variable may contain. A data type is a term which refers to the kinds of data that variables may hold. With every programming language there is a set of built-in data types. This means that the language allows variables to name data of that type and provides a set of operations which meaningfully manipulates these variables. Some data types are easy to provide because they are built-in into the computer\u2019s machine language instruction set, such as integer, character etc. Other data types require considerably more efficient to implement. In some languages, these are features which allow one to construct combinations of the built-in types ( like structures in \u2018C\u2019). However, it is necessary to have such mechanism to create the new complex data types which are not provided by the programming language. The new type also must be meaningful for manipulations. Such meaningful data types are referred as abstract data type. Definition of Data Structure Primitive data type: The data structures, typically those data structure that are directly operated upon by machine level instructions i.e. the fundamental data types such as int, float, double in case of \u2018c\u2019 are known as primitive data structures. The term \"data type\" and \"primitive data type\" are often used interchangeably. Primitive data types are predefined types of data, which are supported by the programming language. For example, integer, character, and string are all primitive data types. Programmers can use these data types when creating variables in their programs. For example, a programmer may create a variable called \"lastname\" and define it as a string data type. The variable will then store data as a string of characters. Integer: This is used to represent a number without decimal point. Eg: 12, 90 Float and Double: This is used to represent a number with decimal point. Eg: 45.1, 67.3 Character : This is used to represent single character Eg: \u2018C\u2019, \u2018a\u2019 String: This is used to represent group of characters. Eg: \"M.S.P.V.L Polytechnic College\" Boolean: This is used represent logical values either true or false. Non-primitive data types are not defined by the programming language, but are instead created by the programmer. They are sometimes called \"reference variables,\" or \"object references,\" since they reference a memory location, which stores the data. In the Java programming language, non-primitive data types are simply called \"objects\" because they are created, rather than predefined. While an object may contain any type of data, the information referenced by the object may still be stored as a primitive data type. The data structures, which are not primitive are called non-primitive data structures. There are two types of non-primitive data structures. Linear Data Structures:- A list, which shows the relationship of adjacency between elements, is said to be linear data structure. The most, simplest linear data structure is a 1-D array, but because of its deficiency, list is frequently used for different kinds of data. Non-linear data structure:-A list, which doesn\u2019t show the relationship of adjacency between elements, is said to be non-linear data structure.

If the value is present in the array, then searching is said to be successful and the searching process gives the location of that value in the array. However, if the value is not present in the array, the searching process displays an appropriate message and in this case searching is said to be unsuccessful. There are two popular methods for searching the array elements: linear search binary search Interpolation search Jump Search Fibonacci Search The algorithm that should be used depends entirely on how the values are organized in the array. For example, if the elements of the array are arranged in ascending order, then binary search should be used, as it is more efficient for sorted lists in terms of complexity. Linear Search Linear search, also called as sequential search, is a very simple method used for searching an array for a particular value. It works by comparing the value to be searched with every element of the array one by one in a sequence until a match is found. Linear search is mostly used to search an unordered list of elements (array in which data elements are not sorted). For example, if an array A[] is declared and initialized as, int A[] = {10, 8, 2, 7, 3, 4, 9, 1, 6, 5}; and the value to be searched is VAL = 7, then searching means to find whether the value \u20187\u2019 is present in the array or not. If yes, then it returns the position of its occurrence. Here, POS = 3 (index starting from 0). ALGORITHM : LINEAR_SEARCH(A, N, VAL) Step 1: [INITIALIZE] SET POS = -1 Step 2: [INITIALIZE] SET I = 1 Step 3: Repeat Step 4 while I<=N Step 4: IF A[I] = VAL SET POS = I PRINT POS Go to Step 6 [END OF IF] SET I = I + 1 [END OF LOOP] Step 5: IF POS = \u20131 PRINT VALUE IS NOT PRESENT IN THE ARRAY [END OF IF] Step 6: Exit Algorithm shows the algorithm for linear search. In Steps 1 and 2 of the algorithm, we initialize the value of POS and I. In Step 3, a while loop is executed that would be executed till I is less than N (total number of elements in the array). In Step 4, a check is made to see if a match is found between the current array element and VAL. If a match is found, then the position of the array element is printed, else the value of I is incremented to match the next element with VAL. However, if all the array elements have been compared with VAL and no match is found, then it means that VAL is not present in the array. Complexity of Linear Search Algorithm Linear search executes in O(n) time where n is the number of elements in the array. Obviously, the best case of linear search is when VAL is equal to the first element of the array. In this case, only one comparison will be made. Likewise, the worst case will happen when either VAL is not present in the array or it is equal to the last element of the array. In both the cases, n comparisons will have to be made. However, the performance of the linear search algorithm can be improved by using a sorted array. Binary Search Binary search is a searching algorithm that works efficiently with a sorted list. The mechanism of binary search can be better understood by an analogy of a telephone directory. When we are searching for a particular name in a directory, we first open the directory from the middle and then decide whether to look for the name in the first part of the directory or in the second part of the directory. Again, we open some page in the middle and the whole process is repeated until we finally find the right name. Take another analogy. How do we find words in a dictionary? We first open the dictionary somewhere in the middle. Then, we compare the first word on that page with the desired word whose meaning we are looking for. If the desired word comes before the word on the page, we look in the first half of the dictionary, else we look in the second half. Again, we open a page in the first half of the dictionary and compare the first word on that page with the desired word and repeat the same procedure until we finally get the word. The same mechanism is applied in the binary search. Now, let us consider how this mechanism is applied to search for a value in a sorted array. Consider an array A[] that is declared and initialized as int A[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; and the value to be searched is VAL = 9. The algorithm will proceed in the following manner. BEG = 0, END = 10, MID = (0 + 10)/2 = 5 Now, VAL = 9 and A[MID] = A[5] = 5 A[5] is less than VAL, therefore, we now search for the value in the second half of the array. So, we change the values of BEG and MID. Now, BEG = MID + 1 = 6, END = 10, MID = (6 + 10)/2 =16/2 = 8 VAL = 9 and A[MID] = A[8] = 8 A[8] is less than VAL, therefore, we now search for the value in the second half of the segment. So, again we change the values of BEG and MID. Now, BEG = MID + 1 = 9, END = 10, MID = (9 + 10)/2 = 9 Now, VAL = 9 and A[MID] = 9. In this algorithm, we see that BEG and END are the beginning and ending positions of the segment that we are looking to search for the element. MID is calculated as (BEG + END)/2. Initially, BEG = lower_bound and END = upper_bound. The algorithm will terminate when A[MID] = VAL. When the algorithm ends, we will set POS = MID. POS is the position at which the value is present in the array. However, if VAL is not equal to A[MID], then the values of BEG, END, and MID will be changed depending on whether VAL is smaller or greater than A[MID]. (a) If VAL < A[MID], then VAL will be present in the left segment of the array. So, the value of END will be changed as END = MID \u2013 1. (b) If VAL > A[MID], then VAL will be present in the right segment of the array. So, the value of BEG will be changed as BEG = MID + 1. Finally, if VAL is not present in the array, then eventually, END will be less than BEG. When this happens, the algorithm will terminate and the search will be unsuccessful. Figure 14.2 shows the algorithm for binary search. In Step 1, we initialize the value of variables, BEG, END, and POS. In Step 2, a while loop is executed until BEG is less than or equal to END. In Step 3, the value of MID is calculated. In Step 4, we check if the array value at MID is equal to VAL (item to be searched in the array). If a match is found, then the value of POS is printed and the algorithm exits. However, if a match is not found, and if the value of A[MID] is greater than VAL, the value of END is modified, otherwise if A[MID] is greater than VAL, then the value of BEG is altered. In Step 5, if the value of POS = \u20131, then VAL is not present in the array and an appropriate message is printed on the screen before the algorithm exits. ALGORITHM : BINARY_SEARCH(A, lower_bound, upper_bound, VAL) Step 1: [INITIALIZE] SET BEG = lower_bound END = upper_bound, POS = - 1 Step 2: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 while BEG <= END Step 3: SET MID = (BEG + END)/2 Step 4: IF A[MID] = VAL SET POS = MID PRINT POS Go to Step 6 ELSE IF A[MID] > VAL SET END = MID - 1 ELSE SET BEG = MID + 1 [END OF IF] [END OF LOOP] Step 5: IF POS = -1 PRINT \u201cVALUE IS NOT PRESENT IN THE ARRAY\u201d [END OF IF] Step 6: EXIT Fibonacci Search We are all well aware of the Fibonacci series in which the first two terms are 0 and 1 and then each successive term is the sum of previous two terms. In the Fibonacci series given below, each number is called a Fibonacci number. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... The same series and concept can be used to search for a given value in a list of numbers. Such a search algorithm which is based on Fibonacci numbers is called Fibonacci search and was developed by Kiefer in 1953. The search follows a divide-and-conquer technique and narrows down possible locations with the help of Fibonacci numbers. Fibonacci search is similar to binary search. It also works on a sorted list and has a run time complexity of O(log n). However, unlike the binary search algorithm, Fibonacci search does not divide the list into two equal halves rather it subtracts a Fibonacci number from the index to reduce the size of the list to be searched. So, the key advantage of Fibonacci search over binary search is that comparison dispersion is low.","title":"UnitV"},{"location":"ec/","text":"E-COMMERCE Link Unit-I E-commerce : Objectives, advantages and disadvantages, Forces driving E-Commerce, Traditional commerce and E-commerce, E-Commerce opportunities for industries.

An abstract class cannot beinstantiated. It can only be used as a superclass for other classes that extendthe abstract class. Abstract classes are declared with the abstract keyword.Abstract classes are used to provide a template or design for concretesubclasses down the inheritance tree. Like any other class, an abstract class can contain fields thatdescribe the characteristics and methods that describe the actions that a classcan perform. An abstract class can include methods that contain noimplementation. These are called abstract methods. The abstract methoddeclaration must then end with a semicolon rather than a block. If a class hasany abstract methods, whether declared or inherited, the entire class must bedeclared abstract. Abstract methods are used to provide a template for theclasses that inherit the abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated; they must be subclassed,and actual implementations must be provided for the abstract methods. Anyimplementation specified can, of course, be overridden by additionalsubclasses. An object must have an implementation for all of its methods. Youneed to create a subclass that provides an implementation for the abstractmethod. A class abstract Vehicle might be specified as abstract torepresent the general abstraction of a vehicle, as creating instances of theclass would not be meaningful. abstract class Vehicle { int numofGears ; String color ; abstract boolean hasDiskBrake (); abstract int getNoofGears (); } Example of a shape class as an abstract class abstract class Shape { public String color ; public Shape () { } public void setColor ( String c ) { color = c ; } public String getColor () { return color ; } abstract public double area (); } We can also implement the generic shapes class as an abstractclass so that we can draw lines, circles, triangles etc. All shapes have somecommon fields and methods, but each can, of course, add more fields andmethods. The abstract class guarantees that each shape will have the same setof basic properties. We declare this class abstract because there is no suchthing as a generic shape. There can only be concrete shapes such as squares,circles, triangles etc. public class Point extends Shape { static int x , y ; public Point () { x = 0 ; y = 0 ; } public double area () { return 0 ; } public double perimeter () { return 0 ; } public static void print () { System . out . println ( \"point: \" + x + \",\" + y ); } public static void main ( String args []) { Point p = new Point (); p . print (); } } Output point: 0 , 0 Notice that, in order to create a Point object, its class cannotbe abstract. This means that all of the abstract methods of the Shape classmust be implemented by the Point class. The subclass must define an implementation for every abstractmethod of the abstract superclass, or the subclass itself will also beabstract. Similarly other shape objects can be created using the generic ShapeAbstract class. A big Disadvantage ofusing abstract classes is not able to use multiple inheritance. In the sense,when a class extends an abstract class, it can\u2019t extend any other class. Java Interface Link In Java, this multiple inheritance problem is solved with apowerful construct called interfaces .Interface can be used to define a generic template and then one or moreabstract classes to define partial implementations of the interface. Interfacesjust specify the method declaration (implicitly public and abstract) and canonly contain fields (which are implicitly public static final). Interfacedefinition begins with a keyword interface. An interface like that of anabstract class cannot be instantiated. Multiple Inheritance is allowed when extending interfaces i.e. oneinterface can extend none, one or more interfaces. Java does not supportmultiple inheritance, but it allows you to extend one class and implement manyinterfaces. If a class that implements an interface does not define all themethods of the interface, then it must be declared abstract and the methoddefinitions must be provided by the subclass that extends the abstract class. Example 1 : Below is an example of a Shapeinterface interface Shape { public double area (); public double volume (); } Below is a Point class that implements theShape interface. public class Point implements Shape { static int x , y ; public Point () { x = 0 ; y = 0 ; } public double area () { return 0 ; } public double volume () { return 0 ; } public static void print () { System . out . println ( \"point: \" + x + \",\" + y ); } public static void main ( String args []) { Point p = new Point (); p . print (); } } Similarly, other shape objects can be created by interfaceprogramming by implementing generic Shape Interface. Example 2 : Belowis a java interfaces program showing the power of interface programming in java Listing below shows 2 interfaces and 4 classes one being an abstract class. Note : The method toString in class A1 is an overridden version of the method defined in the class named Object . The classes B1 and C1 satisfy the interface contract. But since the class** D1** does not define all the methods of the implemented interface I2 , the class D1 is declared abstract. Also, i1.methodI2() produces a compilation error as the method is not declared in I1 or any of its super interfaces if present. Hence a downcast of interface reference I1 solves the problem as shown in the program. The same problem applies to i1.methodA1(), which is again resolved by a downcast. When we invoke the toString() method which is a method of anObject, there does not seem to be any problem as every interface or classextends Object and any class can override the default toString() to suit yourapplication needs. ((C1)o1).methodI1() compiles successfully, but produces aClassCastException at runtime. This is because B1 does not have anyrelationship with C1 except they are \u201csiblings\u201d.

An abstract class cancontain no abstract methods also i.e. abstract class may contain concretemethods. A Java Interface can contain only method declarations and publicstatic final constants and doesn\u2019t contain their implementation. The classeswhich implement the Interface must provide the method definition for all themethods present. Abstract class definition begins with the keyword \u201cabstract\u201dkeyword followed by Class definition. An Interface definition begins with thekeyword \u201cinterface\u201d. Abstract classes are useful in a situation when some generalmethods should be implemented and specialization behavior should be implementedby subclasses. Interfaces are useful in a situation when all its propertiesneed to be implemented by subclasses All variables in an Interface are by default - public staticfinal while an abstract class can have instance variables. An interface is also used in situations when a class needs toextend an other class apart from the abstract class. In such situations its notpossible to have multiple inheritance of classes. An interface on the otherhand can be used when it is required to implement one or more interfaces.Abstract class does not support Multiple Inheritance whereas an Interfacesupports multiple Inheritance. An Interface can only have public members whereas an abstractclass can contain private as well as protected members. A class implementing an interface must implement all of themethods defined in the interface, while a class extending an abstract class neednot implement any of the methods defined in the abstract class. The problem with an interface is, if you want to add a newfeature (method) in its contract, then you MUST implement those method in allof the classes which implement that interface. However, in the case of anabstract class, the method can be simply implemented in the abstract class andthe same can be called by its subclass Interfaces are slow as it requires extra indirection to to findcorresponding method in in the actual class. Abstract classes are fast Interfaces are often used to describe the peripheral abilities of a class, and not its central identity, E.g. an Automobile class might implement the Recyclable interface, which could apply to many otherwise totally unrelated objects. Note: There is no difference between a fully abstract class (all methods declared as abstract and all fields are public static final) and an interface. Note: If the various objects are all of-a-kind, and share a common state and behavior, then tend towards a common base class. If all they share is a set of method signatures, then tend towards an interface.","title":"Abstract and Interface"},{"location":"java/Abstract%20and%20Interface/#abstract-class-in-java","text":"Java Abstract classes are used to declare common characteristics of subclasses. An abstract class cannot beinstantiated. It can only be used as a superclass for other classes that extendthe abstract class. Abstract classes are declared with the abstract keyword.Abstract classes are used to provide a template or design for concretesubclasses down the inheritance tree. Like any other class, an abstract class can contain fields thatdescribe the characteristics and methods that describe the actions that a classcan perform. An abstract class can include methods that contain noimplementation. These are called abstract methods. The abstract methoddeclaration must then end with a semicolon rather than a block. If a class hasany abstract methods, whether declared or inherited, the entire class must bedeclared abstract. Abstract methods are used to provide a template for theclasses that inherit the abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated; they must be subclassed,and actual implementations must be provided for the abstract methods. Anyimplementation specified can, of course, be overridden by additionalsubclasses. An object must have an implementation for all of its methods. Youneed to create a subclass that provides an implementation for the abstractmethod. A class abstract Vehicle might be specified as abstract torepresent the general abstraction of a vehicle, as creating instances of theclass would not be meaningful. abstract class Vehicle { int numofGears ; String color ; abstract boolean hasDiskBrake (); abstract int getNoofGears (); } Example of a shape class as an abstract class abstract class Shape { public String color ; public Shape () { } public void setColor ( String c ) { color = c ; } public String getColor () { return color ; } abstract public double area (); } We can also implement the generic shapes class as an abstractclass so that we can draw lines, circles, triangles etc. All shapes have somecommon fields and methods, but each can, of course, add more fields andmethods. The abstract class guarantees that each shape will have the same setof basic properties. We declare this class abstract because there is no suchthing as a generic shape. There can only be concrete shapes such as squares,circles, triangles etc. public class Point extends Shape { static int x , y ; public Point () { x = 0 ; y = 0 ; } public double area () { return 0 ; } public double perimeter () { return 0 ; } public static void print () { System . out . println ( \"point: \" + x + \",\" + y ); } public static void main ( String args []) { Point p = new Point (); p . print (); } } Output point: 0 , 0 Notice that, in order to create a Point object, its class cannotbe abstract. This means that all of the abstract methods of the Shape classmust be implemented by the Point class. The subclass must define an implementation for every abstractmethod of the abstract superclass, or the subclass itself will also beabstract. Similarly other shape objects can be created using the generic ShapeAbstract class. A big Disadvantage ofusing abstract classes is not able to use multiple inheritance. In the sense,when a class extends an abstract class, it can\u2019t extend any other class.","title":"Abstract Class in JAVA"},{"location":"java/Abstract%20and%20Interface/#java-interface","text":"In Java, this multiple inheritance problem is solved with apowerful construct called interfaces .Interface can be used to define a generic template and then one or moreabstract classes to define partial implementations of the interface. Interfacesjust specify the method declaration (implicitly public and abstract) and canonly contain fields (which are implicitly public static final). Interfacedefinition begins with a keyword interface. An interface like that of anabstract class cannot be instantiated. Multiple Inheritance is allowed when extending interfaces i.e. oneinterface can extend none, one or more interfaces. Java does not supportmultiple inheritance, but it allows you to extend one class and implement manyinterfaces. If a class that implements an interface does not define all themethods of the interface, then it must be declared abstract and the methoddefinitions must be provided by the subclass that extends the abstract class. Example 1 : Below is an example of a Shapeinterface interface Shape { public double area (); public double volume (); } Below is a Point class that implements theShape interface. public class Point implements Shape { static int x , y ; public Point () { x = 0 ; y = 0 ; } public double area () { return 0 ; } public double volume () { return 0 ; } public static void print () { System . out . println ( \"point: \" + x + \",\" + y ); } public static void main ( String args []) { Point p = new Point (); p . print (); } } Similarly, other shape objects can be created by interfaceprogramming by implementing generic Shape Interface. Example 2 : Belowis a java interfaces program showing the power of interface programming in java Listing below shows 2 interfaces and 4 classes one being an abstract class. Note : The method toString in class A1 is an overridden version of the method defined in the class named Object . The classes B1 and C1 satisfy the interface contract. But since the class** D1** does not define all the methods of the implemented interface I2 , the class D1 is declared abstract. Also, i1.methodI2() produces a compilation error as the method is not declared in I1 or any of its super interfaces if present. Hence a downcast of interface reference I1 solves the problem as shown in the program. The same problem applies to i1.methodA1(), which is again resolved by a downcast. When we invoke the toString() method which is a method of anObject, there does not seem to be any problem as every interface or classextends Object and any class can override the default toString() to suit yourapplication needs. ((C1)o1).methodI1() compiles successfully, but produces aClassCastException at runtime. This is because B1 does not have anyrelationship with C1 except they are \u201csiblings\u201d.

Access Modifiers are used at 2 access levels in Java. 1. ****Top-level for Classes & Interfaces a. Default Visible to the same package only. not accessiblein other packages or sub packages**** do not explicitly declare**** b. Public Visible to the world**** 2. ****Member-level for Classes & Interfaces a. Public Visible to the world**** b. Protected Visible to the package and all subclasses of itsclass in any package where this class is visible. c. Default Visible to the same package only. not accessiblein other packages or sub packages**** do not explicitly declare**** d. Private Visible to the class only 3. ****Non-Access Modifiers a. Static Members Static members are the members with Statickeyword in their declarations. Class variables are called as Static variables.These members belong to the class not to the object i.e. they are notinstantiated when the class instance is created. The values of these variables are not part ofthe object state. The static variables are initialized to theirdefault values (if explicit initialization is not specified) at the time ofclass loading. The Static methods are called as classmethods . A static method can directly access other static members in theclass. It cannot access instance (non-static) members of the class. But it canalways use a reference of the class type to access its members both static andnon-static. b. Final Member Final variable is a constant; its value cannotbe changed after its initialization. This applies to instance, static and localvariables including parameters that are declared as final. A final variable of primitive data type cannotchange its value once it has been initialized. A final variable of a referencetype cannot change its reference value once it has been initialized, but thestate of the object it denotes can still be changed. Note Variables defined in Interfaces are implicitlyFinal. Final variables must be initialized before it isused. Final methods in a class are complete i.e. thesemethods have implementations and hence cannot be overridden in the subclasses. c. Abstract If method has a keyword abstract in itsdeclaration, then such method/function is called Abstract method. Abstractmethods do not have an implementation i.e. method body is not defined; onlymethod prototype is specified in the class definition. Note: Only instance methods can be declared asabstract. Since Static methods cannot be overriddendeclaring abstract static method would of no use. A Final method cannot be abstract and viceversa. Methods specified in an Interface are implicitlyabstract. Class: **Contains abstract methods. Cannotbe instantiated** **Interface: **All interfaces are implicitlyabstract. The modifier is optional. Method : Method without a body. Signatureis followed by a semicolon. The class must also be abstract. d. Synchronized Methods: Multiple threads can be executing in a programand at times they might try to execute several methods on the same objectsimultaneously. - If there is a requirement that only one threadat a time should execute a method in the object, then such methods can bedeclared as Synchronized. Their execution will be mutually exclusive among allthreads. At any given time, at the most one thread will be executing a Synchronizedmethod on an object. Note Synchronized methods are also applicable toStatic methods of a class. e. Native Methods Native Methods are also called as Foreignmethods. Such methods implementation is not defined in Java but in anotherprogramming language. These methods are specified in the class asmethod prototypes with prefix with keyword native, no method body is defined inthe Java class. f. Transient Fields Objects can be stored using serialization.Serialization transforms objects into an output format which is helpful forstoring objects. Objects can later be retrieved in the same state as when theywere serialized, meaning that fields included in the serialization will havethe same values at the time of serialization. Such objects are said to bePersistent. The fields are declared with keyword Transientin their class declaration if its value should not be saved when objects of theclass are written to persistent storage. g. Volatile Fields During execution, complied code might cache thevalues of fields for efficiency reasons. And as multiple threads will accessthe same field, caching is not allowed to cause inconsistencies when readingand writing the value in the field. The Volatile modifier can be used to inform thecompiler that it should not attempt to perform optimizations on the field whichcould cause unpredicted results when the field is accessed by multiple threads Accessibility Modifiers for Nested Classes &Interfaces h. Nested Interfaces Access modifiers can be used in Nestedinterfaces. An interface declared within another class or interface is called aNested interface. A top-level interface is the one which is not nested. Only one type of nested interface is availablein Java based on declarative context, Static member interface. These are interfacesdefined with keyword Static inside the top-level interface or class or inanother Static member class or interface. It can be instantiated like a normaltop-level interface or class, no enclosing instance is required for thisinterface instantiation. i. Nested Classes Access modifiers are also used in Nestedclasses. A class declared within another class is called a Nested class. Atop-level class is the one which is not nested. They are 2 categories of Nested classes based onthe declarative context. They are Static member classes Inner classes a. Inner classes are defined in 3 differentcategories. They are b. Non-static member classes c. Local classes d. Anonymous classes j. Static member classes Classes which are defined with Static modifierinside the top-level class or other Static member class are called Staticmember classes. It can be instantiated like a normal top-level class; noenclosing instance is required for this class instantiation. All the 4 accessibility modifiers i.e. Public,Protected, Package & Private are applicable to Static member classes\u2019declaration. k. Non-Static member classes Classes which are defined without Staticmodifier inside another class are called non-static member classes. An instanceof a non-static member class always has an enclosing instance associated withit. The accessibility modifiers i.e. Public,Protected, Package & Private,abstract, final are applicable to Non-Staticmember classes\u2019 declaration. l. Local classes These classes are defined in the context of ablock as in a body of the method or normal local block, just as local variablesdefined in a method body or local block. An instance of a local class has anenclosing instance associated with it, if it is declared in non-static context. No accessibility modifiers are applicable forLocal classes. m. Anonymous classes These are defined as expressions andinstantiated on the fly. An instance of anonymous class has an enclosinginstance associated with it, if it is declared in non-static context. No accessibility modifiers are applicable forAnonymous classes. Note A Nested Class or Interface cannot have the samename as any of the enclosing classes or interfaces.","title":"Modifiers"},{"location":"java/Java%20Notes/#modifiers","text":"Access modifiers Non-Access Modifiers Abstract methods and Classes Final Variables and Methods, FinalClasses, Finalize Methods Static Members Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods, and constructors.

Signatureis followed by a semicolon. The class must also be abstract. d. Synchronized Methods: Multiple threads can be executing in a programand at times they might try to execute several methods on the same objectsimultaneously. - If there is a requirement that only one threadat a time should execute a method in the object, then such methods can bedeclared as Synchronized. Their execution will be mutually exclusive among allthreads. At any given time, at the most one thread will be executing a Synchronizedmethod on an object. Note Synchronized methods are also applicable toStatic methods of a class. e. Native Methods Native Methods are also called as Foreignmethods. Such methods implementation is not defined in Java but in anotherprogramming language. These methods are specified in the class asmethod prototypes with prefix with keyword native, no method body is defined inthe Java class. f. Transient Fields Objects can be stored using serialization.Serialization transforms objects into an output format which is helpful forstoring objects. Objects can later be retrieved in the same state as when theywere serialized, meaning that fields included in the serialization will havethe same values at the time of serialization. Such objects are said to bePersistent. The fields are declared with keyword Transientin their class declaration if its value should not be saved when objects of theclass are written to persistent storage. g. Volatile Fields During execution, complied code might cache thevalues of fields for efficiency reasons. And as multiple threads will accessthe same field, caching is not allowed to cause inconsistencies when readingand writing the value in the field. The Volatile modifier can be used to inform thecompiler that it should not attempt to perform optimizations on the field whichcould cause unpredicted results when the field is accessed by multiple threads Accessibility Modifiers for Nested Classes &Interfaces h. Nested Interfaces Access modifiers can be used in Nestedinterfaces. An interface declared within another class or interface is called aNested interface. A top-level interface is the one which is not nested. Only one type of nested interface is availablein Java based on declarative context, Static member interface. These are interfacesdefined with keyword Static inside the top-level interface or class or inanother Static member class or interface. It can be instantiated like a normaltop-level interface or class, no enclosing instance is required for thisinterface instantiation. i. Nested Classes Access modifiers are also used in Nestedclasses. A class declared within another class is called a Nested class. Atop-level class is the one which is not nested. They are 2 categories of Nested classes based onthe declarative context. They are Static member classes Inner classes a. Inner classes are defined in 3 differentcategories. They are b. Non-static member classes c. Local classes d. Anonymous classes j. Static member classes Classes which are defined with Static modifierinside the top-level class or other Static member class are called Staticmember classes. It can be instantiated like a normal top-level class; noenclosing instance is required for this class instantiation. All the 4 accessibility modifiers i.e. Public,Protected, Package & Private are applicable to Static member classes\u2019declaration. k. Non-Static member classes Classes which are defined without Staticmodifier inside another class are called non-static member classes. An instanceof a non-static member class always has an enclosing instance associated withit. The accessibility modifiers i.e. Public,Protected, Package & Private,abstract, final are applicable to Non-Staticmember classes\u2019 declaration. l. Local classes These classes are defined in the context of ablock as in a body of the method or normal local block, just as local variablesdefined in a method body or local block. An instance of a local class has anenclosing instance associated with it, if it is declared in non-static context. No accessibility modifiers are applicable forLocal classes. m. Anonymous classes These are defined as expressions andinstantiated on the fly. An instance of anonymous class has an enclosinginstance associated with it, if it is declared in non-static context. No accessibility modifiers are applicable forAnonymous classes. Note A Nested Class or Interface cannot have the samename as any of the enclosing classes or interfaces.","title":"Modifiers"},{"location":"java/Paper/","text":"2010 Link Unit-I Link Describe Following a.

Example class MyFirstJavaClass \u00b7 Method Names - All method names should startwith a Lower Case letter. If several words are used to form the name ofthe method, then each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case. Example public void myMethodName() \u00b7 Program File Name - Name of the program fileshould exactly match the class name. When saving the file, you should save itusing the class name (Remember Java is case sensitive) and append '.java' to the end of the name (if the filename and the class name do not match your program will not compile). Example : Assume 'MyFirstJavaProgram' is theclass name, then the file should be saved as'MyFirstJavaProgram.java' \u00b7 public static void main(String args[]) - Javaprogram processing starts from the main() method, which is a mandatory part ofevery Java program. Java Identifier \u00b7 All Java components require names. Names usedfor classes, variables and methods are called identifiers. \u00b7 In Java, there are several points to rememberabout identifiers. They are as follows: \u00b7 All identifiers should begin with a letter (Ato Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_). \u00b7 After the first character, identifiers canhave any combination of characters. \u00b7 A keyword cannot be used as an identifier. \u00b7 Most importantly identifiers are casesensitive. \u00b7 Examples of legal identifiers:age, $salary,_value, __1_value \u00b7 Examples of illegal identifiers: 123abc,-salary Java Modifiers Like other languages, it is possible to modify classes,methods, etc., by using modifiers. There are two categories of modifiers: \u2022 Access Modifiers: default, public, protected, private \u2022 Non-access Modifiers: final, abstract, strictfp We will be looking into more details about modifiers inthe next section. Java Variables: We would see following type of variables in Java: \u2022 Local Variables \u2022 Class Variables (Static Variables) \u2022 Instance Variables (Non-static variables) **Java Arrays: ** Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of thesame type. However, an array itself is an object on the heap. We will look into how to declare, construct andinitialize in the upcoming chapters. **Java Enums: ** Enums were introduced in java 5.0. Enums restrict avariable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums. With the use of enums, it is possible to reduce thenumber of bugs in your code. For example, if we consider an application for a freshjuice shop, it would be possible to restrict the glass size to small, medium and large. This would make sure that itwould not allow anyone to order any size other than the small, medium or large.","title":"Terminology"},{"location":"java/UnitI/","text":"Unit I Link An overview of Java: Object oriented programming, Two paradigms, abstraction, the, OOP principles, Java class libraries, variables, arrays, Data types and casting, Operators, operator precedence, Control statements. Introduction of Java Link Java is one of the world's most important and widely used computer languages, and it has held this distinction for many years. Unlike some other computer languages whose influence has weared with passage of time, while java's has grown. Java is related to C++, which is a direct descendant of C. Much of the character of Java is inherited from these two languages. From C, Java derives its syntax. Many of Java\u2019s object- oriented features were influenced by C++. In fact, several of Java\u2019s defining characteristics come from\u2014or are responses to\u2014its predecessors. Till today it is the first and best choice for developing console/web-based applications. Evolution of Java, Creation of Java, History of Java Link JAVA is a distributed technology developed by James Gosling, Patric Naugton, etc., at Sun Micro System has released lot of rules for JAVA and those rules are implemented by JavaSoft Inc, USA (which is the software division of Sun Micro System) in the year 1990. The original name of JAVA is OAK (which is a tree name). In the year 1995, OAK was revised and developed software called JAVA (which is a coffee seed name). James Ghosling, Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan initiated the Java language project in June 1991 at Sun Microsystems Inc. for use in one of his many set-top box projects. It took 18 months to develop the first working version. Thelanguage, initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office, also went by the name Green and ended up later being renamed as Java, from a list of random words. Java was initially launched as Java 1.0 as core component of Sun Microsystems\u2019 Java platform. Sun released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. but soon after its initial release, Java 1.1 was launched. Java 1.1 redefined event handling, new library elements were added. In Java 1.2 Swing and Collection framework was added and suspend() , resume() and stop() methods were deprecated from Thread class. No major changes were made into Java 1.3 but the next release that was Java 1.4 contained several important changes.Keyword assert , chained exceptions and channel based I/O System was introduced. Java 1.5 was called J2SE 5, it added following major new features: \u00b7 Generics \u00b7 Annotations \u00b7 Autoboxingand autounboxing \u00b7 Enumerations \u00b7 For-each Loop \u00b7 Varargs \u00b7 Static Import \u00b7 Formatted I/O \u00b7 Concurrency utilities On 13 November 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On 8 May 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core code free andopen-source, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright. December 2008, the latest release of the Java Standard Edition is 6 (J2SE). With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suite various types of platforms. Ex: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications. Nextmajor release was Java SE 7 which included many new changes like : \u00b7 NowString can be used to control Swith statement. \u00b7 MultiCatch Exception \u00b7 try-with-resourcestatement \u00b7 BinaryInteger Literals \u00b7 Underscorein numeric literals. JAVA released to the market in three categories J2SE (JAVA 2 Standard Edition), J2EE (JAVA 2 Enterprise Edition) and J2ME (JAVA 2 Micro/Mobile Edition). J2SE is basically used for developing client side applications/programs. J2EE is used for developing server side applications/programs. J2ME is used for developing Mobile/PDA applications/programs If you exchange the data between client and server programs (J2SE and J2EE), by default JAVA is having on internal support with a protocol called http. J2ME is used for developing mobile applications and lower/system level applications. To develop J2ME applications we must use a protocol called WAP (Wireless Applications Protocol). Features of Java Link The prime reason behind creation of Java was to bring portability and security feature into a computer language. Beside these two major features, there were many other features that played an important role in moulding out the final form of this outstanding language. Those features are : Simple Platform independent Architectural neutral Portable Multi threading Distributed Networked Robust Dynamic Secured High performance Interpreted Object Oriented Programming Language Simple Link JAVA is simple because of the following factors: JAVA is free from pointers hence we can achieve less development time and less execution time [whenever we write a JAVA program we write without pointers and internally it is converted into the equivalent pointer program]. Rich set of API (application protocol interface) is available to develop any complex application. The software JAVA contains a program called garbage collector which is always used to collect unreferenced (unused) memory location for improving performance of a JAVA program. [Garbage collector is the system JAVA program which runs in the background along with regular JAVA program to collect unreferenced memory locations by running at periodical interval of times for improving performance of JAVA applications. JAVA contains user friendly syntax\u2019s for developing JAVA applications. Platform Independent Link A program or technology is said to be platform independent if and only if which can run on all available operating systems. Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run. On compilation Java program is compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is platform independent and can be run on any machine, plus this bytecode format also provide security. Any machine with Java Runtime Environment can run Java Programs. The languages like C, Cpp are treated as platform dependent languages since these languages are taking various amount of memory spaces on various operating systems [the operating system dos understands everything in the form of its native format called Mozart (MZ) whereas the operating system Unix understands everything in its negative format called embedded linking format (elf). When we write a C or Cpp program on dos operating and if we try to transfer that program to Unix operating system, we are unable to execute since the format of these operating systems are different and more over the C, Cpp software does not contain any special programs which converts one format of one operating system to another format of other operating system]. The language like JAVA will have a common data types and the common memory spaces on all operating systems and the JAVA software contains the special programs which converts the format of one operating system to another format of other operating system. Hence JAVA language is treated as platform independent language. [JAVA language is also treated as server independent language since the server side program can run on any of the server which is available in the real world (web server or application server). JAVA can retrieve or store the data in any one of the data base product which is available in rest world irrespective of their vendors (developers) hence JAVA language is product independent language. In order to deal with server side program from the client side, we can use C language client program, Cpp client program, DOT NET client program, etc. hence JAVA language is a simple, platform independent, server independent, data base/product independent and language independent programming language]. Architectural Neutral Link Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code to be executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system. A language or technology is said to be processors in the real world. The language like JAVA can run on any of the processor irrespective of their vendor. Portable Link A portable language is one which can run on all operating systems and on all processors irrespective their architectures and providers. The language like C, Cpp are treated as nonportable languages whereas the language Java is called portable language Multi Threading Link With Java's multithreaded feature, it is possible to write programs that can do many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows developers to construct smoothly running interactive applications. Benefit of multithreading is that it utilizes same memory and other resources to execute multiple threads at the same time, like While typing, grammatical errors are checked along. A flow of control is known as thread. A multi threaded program is one in which there exist multiple flow of controls ie. threads. A program is said to be multi threaded program programs if and only of there exist n number of subprograms. For each and every sub flow of controls. All such flow of controls are executing concurrently. such flow of controls is know as threads. Such type of applications is known as multi threading applications. The languages like C, Cpp are treated as threads as single threaded modeling languages(STML). STML are those in which there exists single flows of control. The languages like JAVA and DOT NET are traeted as multithreaded modeling languages(MTML). MTML are those in which there exist multiple flows of controls. Whenever we write a java program there exists by default two threads. They are foreground/child thread and background/main/parent thread. A foreground thread is one which always executes user defined sub program. In a java program there is a possibility of existing n number of foregrounds threads. A background thread is one which always monitors the status of foreground thread. In each and every JAVA program there exist only one background thread. Hence background thread will be created first and later foreground thread will be created Distributed Link Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet. A service is a said to be a distributed service which runs in multiple servers and that service can be accessed by n number of clients across the globe. In order to develop we must require architecture called trusted network architecture.To develop these applications we require a technology called J2EE. A service is a said to be a can be accessed by n number of clients across the globe. In order to develop applications we must require architecture called applications we require a technology called scale organizations.

In each foreground thread will be created. Networked Link In real world we have two types of networks. They are untrusted and trsuted networks. Un-trusted networks : A network is said to be untrusted network in which there exist n number of inter connected non-autonomous architecture. Untrusted network is also know as LAN. Using this network architecture , we develop centralized applications. A Centralized application is one which runs on single server and runs on single server and it can be access in limited graces. In order to develop centralized application we may use a technology called J2Se and these kinds of applications are preferred by small scale organization. 2. Trusted network: A network is said to be trusted network in which there exist n number of interconnected autonomous architecture. Trusted network is also know as a WAN. Using this network, we can develop distributed applications. and it can be access in unlimited graces. In order to develop distributed applications we may use a technology called J2EE and these kinds of applications are preferred by large scale organization. Dynamic Link Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time. Portable Link Being architectural-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary which is a POSIX subset. High Performance Link With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance. Interpreted Link Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and lightweight process. Secure Link With Java's secure feature, it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption. Object Oriented Link In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model. Robust Link Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking. Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone codes by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking. But the main areas which Java improved were Memory Management and mishandled Exceptions by introducing automatic Garbage Collector and Exception Handling.

There are more than 930 million JRE downloads each year and 3 billion mobile phones run java. Following are some other usage of Java : Developing Desktop Application Web Applications like LinkedIn Mobile OS like Android Embedded System Robotics and games etc. How to create JAVA program For creating java program you install jdk toolbox and configure properly according to system then use any ASCII text Editor and following steps. Create a MyFirstJavaProgram.java Open notepad and add the code as above. Save thefile as: MyFirstJavaProgram.java. Open acommand prompt window and go o the directory where you saved the class. Assumeit's C:. Type 'javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java ' and press enter to compile your code. If thereare no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the nextline(Assumption : The path variable is set). Now, type' java MyFirstJavaProgram ' to run your program. You willbe able to see ' Hello World ' printed on the window. public class MyFirstJavaProgram { /* This is my first java program. \\* This will print 'Hello World' as the output */ public static void main ( String [] args ) { System . out . println ( \"HelloWorld\" ); // prints Hello World } } //For Output C: > javac MyFirstJavaProgram . java C: > java MyFirstJavaProgram HelloWorld Difference between class and object Properties Class Object A class is a way of binding the data and associated methods in a single unit Class variable is knows as an object Whenever we start executing a JAVA program, the class will be loaded into main memory with the help of class loader subsystem(a part of JVM) only once After loading the class into main memory, objects can be created in n number. When the class id defined there is no memory space for data members of a class When an object is created we get the memory space for data members of the class Operators Link Java has well-defined rules for specifying the order in which the operators in an expression are evaluated when the expression has several operators. For example, multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Precedence rules can be overridden by explicit parentheses. Precedence order When two operators share an operand the operator with the higher precedence goes first. For example, 1 + 2 * 3 is treated as 1 + (2 * 3), whereas 1 * 2 + 3 is treated as (1 * 2) + 3 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition. Associativity When an expression has two operators with the same precedence, the expression is evaluated according to its associativity. For example x = y = z = 17 is treated as x = (y = (z = 17)), leaving all three variables with the value 17, since the = operator has right-to-left associativity (and an assignment statement evaluates to the value on the right hand side). On the other hand, 72 / 2 / 3 is treated as (72 / 2) / 3 since the / operator has left-to-right associativity. Precedence and associativity of Java operators The table below shows all Java operators from highest to lowest precedence, along with their associativity. Most programmers do not memorize them all, and even those that do still use parentheses for clarity. Order of evaluation of subexpressions Associativity and precedence determine in which order Java applies operators to subexpressions but they do not determine in which order the subexpressions are evaluated. In Java, subexpressions are evaluated from left to right (when there is a choice). So, for example in the expression A() + B() * C(D(), E()), the subexpressions are evaluated in the order A(), B(), D(), E(), and C(). Although, C() appears to the left of both D() and E(), we need the results of both D() and E() to evaluate C(). It is considered poor style to write code that relies upon this behavior (and different programming languages may use different rules). Short circuiting When using the conditional and and or operators (&& and ||), Java does not evaluate the second operand unless it is necessary to resolve the result. This allows statements like if (s != null && s.length() < 10) to work reliably. Programmers rarely use the non short-circuiting versions (& and |) with boolean expressions. Precedence order gone awry Sometimes the precedence order defined in a language do not conform with mathematical norms. For example, in Microsoft Excel, -a^b is interpreted as (-a)^b instead of -(a^b). So -1^2 is equal to 1 instead of -1, which is the values most mathematicians would expect. Microsoft acknowledges this quirk as a \"design choice\". One wonders whether the programmer was relying on the C precedence order in which unary operators have higher precedence than binary operators. This rule agrees with mathematical conventions for all C operators, but fails with the addition of the exponentiation operator. Once the order was established in Microsoft Excel 2.0, it could not easily be changed without breaking backward compatibility. Operator Description Level Associativity [] .

The word \u2018cast\u2019 is used at places where the developer needs to explicitly tell the compiler that the instance value needs to be converted. Attaching the cast-operator (a type between parentheses), before an object is referred as cast. type-safety in Java Link Type-safety is the mechanism provided in a programming language to ensure that there are no issues because of type mismatch between a variable and value attempted to store in it. In Java to ensure type-safety, during compile time the compiler will check for type information between variables using the static type information available. Then during runtime the values are checked for compatibility before storing in a variable. As per Java language specification (SE7-JLS-5.0) conversions are broadly categorized as, Identity conversions Widening primitive conversions Narrowing primitive conversions Widening reference conversions Narrowing reference conversions Boxing conversions Unboxing conversions Unchecked conversions Capture conversions String conversions Value set conversions Identity Conversion Link This is given for theoretical completeness. Assigning two instance of same type is identity conversion. Integer i1 ; Integer i2 = new Integer ( 2 ); i1 = i2 ; //identity conversion // cast not required, but done compiler will not complain i1 = ( Integer ) i2 ; Primitive Conversions and Type Cast in Java Link Assigning a value of one type to a variable of another type is known as Type Casting. When the data is converted from one data type to another data type, then it is called type casting. Type casting is nothing but changing the type of the data. Using type casting, only type of the data can be changed but not the data itself. Example : int x = 10 ; byte y = ( byte ) x ; In Java, type casting is classified into two types, Widening Casting(Implicit) Narrowing Casting(Explicitly done) Widening Primitive Conversion or Automatic type conversion Link Automatic Type casting take place when, the two types are compatible the target type is larger than the source type. \u201cA widening primitive conversion does not lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value.\u201d There is no cast required and will never result in a runtime exception. Following are the possible widening conversions, byte to short, int, long, float, or double short to int, long, float, or double char to int, long, float, or double int to long, float, or double long to float or double float to double Example: public class Test { public static void main ( String [] args ) { int i = 100 ; long l = i ; //no explicit type casting required float f = l ; //no explicit type casting required System . out . println ( \"Int value \" + i ); System . out . println ( \"Long value \" + l ); System . out . println ( \"Float value \" + f ); } } Output : Int value 100 Long value 100 Float value 100.0 /*------------------------------*/ class WideningConversion { public static void main ( String [] args ) { int i = 123456789 ; float f = i ; } } Narrowing or Explicit type conversion Link When you are assigning a larger type value to a variable of smaller type, then you need to perform explicit type casting. \u201cA narrowing primitive conversion may lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value and may also lose precision and range.\u201d Cast required between types. Overflow and underflow may happen but a runtime exception will never happen. Following are the possible narrowing conversions, short to byte or char char to byte or short int to byte, short, or char long to byte, short, char, or int float to byte, short, char, int, or long double to byte, short, char, int, long, or float Example : public class Test { public static void main ( String [] args ) { double d = 100.04 ; long l = ( long ) d ; //explicit type casting required int i = ( int ) l ; //explicit type casting required System . out . println ( \"Double value \" + d ); System . out . println ( \"Long value \" + l ); System . out . println ( \"Int value \" + i ); } } Output : Double value 100.04 Long value 100 Int value 100 /*------------------------------------------------*/ public class NarrowingPrimitiveConversion { public static void main ( String [] args ) { float f = Float . POSITIVE_INFINITY ; long l = ( long ) f ; int i = ( int ) f ; System . out . println ( \"long: \" + l + \" int: \" + i ); int j = 255 ; byte b = ( byte ) j ; // size is too large and resulted in negative System . out . println ( b ); } } Reference Conversions and Cast in Java Link In this section let us see about categories, widening reference conversion and narrowing reference conversion. With respect to classes and objects, there are four categories to understand for casting. Assigning a Float object to Integer directly has got nothing to do with casting and it will throw a compile error as incompatible type. Casting a Float into Integer is not proper and will get compile error as inconvertible types. Casting in Java is done within same hierarchy of types, that is between inherited types. upcast \u2013 Casting a subtype object into a supertype and this is called upcast. In Java, we need not add an explicit cast and you can assign the object directly. Compiler will understand and cast the value to supertype. By doing this, we are lifting an object to a generic level. If we prefer, we can add an explicit cast and no issues. downcast \u2013 Casting a supertype to a subtype is called downcast. This is the mostly done cast. By doing this we are telling the compiler that the value stored in the base object is of a super type. Then we are asking the runtime to assign the value. Because of downcast we get access to methods of the subtype on that object. ClassCastExcpetion \u2013 We get ClassCastException in a downcast. In principle, we guarantee the compiler that the instance value of is subtype and ask it to cast. But during runtime, because of unforeseen circumstances, the value is not of expected subtype. In such cases, we get ClassCastException. Autoboxing and Unboxing in Java Link Converting from a primitive type to its corresponding reference type is boxing conversion and vice versa is Unboxing conversion. Examples are, From primitive boolean to type Boolean From primitive int to type Integer int i = 10 ; Integer iObj = new Integer ( 100 ); iObj = i ; //boxing conversion i = iObj ; //unboxing conversion **Autoboxing: **Converting a primitive value into an object of the corresponding wrapper class is called autoboxing. For example, converting int to Integer class. The Java compiler applies autoboxing when a primitive value is: Passed as a parameter to a method that expects an object of the corresponding wrapper class. Assigned to a variable of the corresponding wrapper class . Unboxing: Converting an object of a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive value is called unboxing. For example conversion of Integer to int. The Java compiler applies unboxing when an object of a wrapper class is: Passed as a parameter to a method that expects a value of the corresponding primitive type. Assigned to a variable of the corresponding primitive type . The following table lists the primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes, which are used by the Java compiler for autoboxing and unboxing: // Java program to illustrate the concept // of Autoboxing and Unboxing` import java.io.* ; class GFG { public static void ` ` main ( String [] args ) ` ` `` { ` ` `` // creating an Integer Object` ` `` // with value 10.` ` `` Integer i = `` new ` ` Integer ( `` 10 `` ); ` ` `` // unboxing the Object` ` `` int ` ` i1 = i ; ` ` `` System . out . println ( `` \"Value of i: \" ` ` + i ); ` ` `` System . out . println ( `` \"Value of i1: \" ` ` + i1 ); ` ` `` //Autoboxing of char` ` `` Character gfg = `` 'a' `` ; ` ` `` // Auto-unboxing of Character` ` `` char ` ` ch = gfg ; ` ` `` System . out . println ( `` \"Value of ch: \" ` ` + ch ); ` ` `` System . out . println ( `` \"Value of gfg: \" ` ` + gfg ); ` ` `` } ` ` } ` Value of i: 10 Value of i1: 10 Value of ch: a Value of gfg: a //Another example to understand how compiler did autoboxing and unboxing in the example of Collections in java using generics. /* Java program to illustrate autoboxing */ import java.io.* ; import java.util.* ; class GFG { public static void main ( String [] args ) { /* Here we are creating a listof elements of Integer type. adding the int primitives type values */ List < Integer > list = new ArrayList < Integer >(); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++) list . add ( i ); } } In above example we have created a list of elements of Integer type. We are adding int primitive type values instead of Integer Object and the code successfully compiled. It does not generate a compile time error as java compiler create Integer wrapper Object from primitive int i and adds it to the list. See the following example for, How it converts\u2026 /* Java program to illustrate autoboxing */ `` import ` ` java . io .*; `` import ` ` java . util .*; ` ` class ` ` GFG `` { `` `` public ` ` static ` ` void ` ` main ( String [] args ) `` `` { `` `` /* Here we are creating a list of elements`` ``of Integer type. Adding the int primitives`` ``type values by converting them into Integer`` ``wrapper Object*/ `` `` List < Integer > list = `` new ` ` ArrayList < Integer >(); `` `` for ` ` ( `` int ` ` i = `` 0 `` ; i < `` 10 `` ; i ++) `` `` list . add ( Integer . valueOf ( i )); ` ` `` } `` } ` Another example of auto and unboxing is to find sum of odd numbers in a list. Important point in the program is that the operators remainder (%) and unary plus (+=) operators do not apply to Integer objects. But still code compiles successfully because the unboxing of Integer Object to primitive int value is taking place by invoking intValue() method at runtime. //Java program to illustrate find sum of odd numbers using autobxing and unboxing import java.io.* ; import java.util.* ; class GFG { public static int sumOfOddNumber ( List < Integer > list ) { int sum = 0 ; for ( Integer i : list ) { // unboxing of i automatically if ( i % 2 != 0 ) sum += i ; /* unboxing of i is done automatically using intvalue implicitly */ if ( i . intValue () % 2 != 0 ) sum += i . intValue (); } return sum ; } public static void main ( String [] args ) { /* Here we are creating a list of elements of Integer type and adding the int primitives type values to the list*/ List < Integer > list = new ArrayList < Integer >(); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++) list . add ( i ); // getting sum of all odd no. in the list. int sumOdd = sumOfOddNumber ( list ); System . out . println ( \"Sum of odd numbers = \" + sumOdd ); } } Output: Sum of odd numbers = 25 Advantages of Autoboxing / Unboxing: Autoboxing and Unboxing lets developers write cleaner code, making it easier to read. The technique let us use primitive types and Wrapper class objects interchangeably and we do not need to perform any typecasting explicitly. String Conversion Link String conversion applies only to the \u2018+\u2019 operator, when one operand is a String and another is a primitive type. In such a case, primitive type is converted to its corresponding reference type and then it is converted using the toString() method. No cast is required. int i = 10 ; String str1 = \"\" ; String str2 = str1 + i ; //string conversion Unchecked and Capture Conversion will be discussed in the next tutorial as part of the generics series. Questions Link Difference between casting and autoboxing What are the types of casting. There are two types of casting. Primitive Casting : When the data is casted from one primitive type ( like int, float, double etc\u2026 ) to another primitive type, then it is called Primitive Casting. Derived Casting : When the data is casted from one derived type to another derived type, then it is called derived casting. What is auto widening and explicit narrowing.? The data is implicitly casted from small sized primitive type to big sized primitive type. This is called auto-widening. i.e The data is automatically casted from byte to short, short to int, int to long, long to float and float to double. You have to explicitly cast the data from big sized primitive type to small sized primitive type. i.e you have to explicitly convert the data from double to float, float to long, long to int, int to short and short to byte This is called explicit narrowing. What is auto-up casting and explicit down casting.? An object of sub class type can be automatically casted to super class type. This is called auto-up casting. An object of super class type should be explicitly casted to sub class type, It is called explicit down casting. Can an int primitive type of data implicitly casted to Double derived type.? Yes, first int is auto-widened to double and then double is auto-boxed to Double. What is ClassCastException.? ClassCastException is an exception which occurs at run time when an object of one type can not be casted to another type. How do you avoid ClassCastException in your code.? By using generics, you can avoid ClassCastException. (Click here to see how you can avoid ClassCastException Using generics.) What is boxing and unboxing.? Wrapping of primitive content into corresponding wrapper class object is called boxing. Unwrapping the wrapper class object into corresponding primitive content is called un boxing. What is the difference between auto-widening, auto-upcasting and auto-boxing.?** Auto-widening occurs when small sized primitive type is casted to big sized primitive type. Auto-up casting occurs when sub class type is casted to super class type. Auto-boxing occurs when primitive type is casted to corresponding wrapper class. What are the priorities of auto-widening, auto-upcasting and auto-boxing.?

It accepts an XML schema andgenerates Java classes. The JDK also called Java Development Kit is a super set of the JRE, and contains everything that is in the JRE, plus tools such as the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and applications. Java Runtime Environment JRE Link The JRE is the software environment in which programs compiled for a typical JVM implementation can run. The runtime system includes: Code necessary to run Java programs, dynamically link native methods, manage memory, and handle exceptions Implementation of the JVM The following figure shows the JRE and its components, including a typical JVM implementation's various modules and its functional position with respect to the JRE and class libraries. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine, and other components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language. JRE does not contain tools and utilities such as compilers or debuggers for developing applets and applications. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Link Java virtual Machine(JVM) is a virtual Machine that provides runtime environment to execute java byte code. The JVM doesn't understand Java typo, that's why you compile your *.java files to obtain *.class files that contain the bytecodes understandable by the JVM. JVM control execution of every Java program. It enables features such as automated exception handling, Garbage-collected heap. The JVM is an abstract computing machine, having an instruction set that uses memory. Virtual machines are often used to implement a programming language. The JVM is the cornerstone of the Java programming language. It is responsible for Java's cross-platform portability and the small size of its compiled code. The Solaris JVM is used to execute Java applications. The Java compiler, javac, outputs bytecodes and puts them into a .class file. The JVM then interprets these bytecodes, which can then be executed by any JVM implementation, thus providing Java's cross-platform portability. The next two figures illustrate the traditional compile-time environment and the new portable Java compile-time environment. Sun Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler Link The Sun Java JIT compiler, an integral part of the Solaris JVM, can accelerate execution performance many times over previous levels. Long-running, compute-intensive programs show the best performance improvement. JIT Compile Process Link When the JIT compiler environment variable is on (the default), the JVM reads the .class file for interpretation and passes it to the JIT compiler. The JIT compiler then compiles the bytecodes into native code for the platform on which it is running. The next figure illustrates the JIT compile process.

The original name of JAVA is OAK (which is a tree name). In the year 1995, OAK was revised and developed software called JAVA (which is a coffee seed name). James Ghosling, Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan initiated the Java language project in June 1991 at Sun Microsystems Inc. for use in one of his many set-top box projects. It took 18 months to develop the first working version. Thelanguage, initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office, also went by the name Green and ended up later being renamed as Java, from a list of random words. Java was initially launched as Java 1.0 as core component of Sun Microsystems\u2019 Java platform. Sun released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. but soon after its initial release, Java 1.1 was launched. Java 1.1 redefined event handling, new library elements were added. In Java 1.2 Swing and Collection framework was added and suspend() , resume() and stop() methods were deprecated from Thread class. No major changes were made into Java 1.3 but the next release that was Java 1.4 contained several important changes.Keyword assert , chained exceptions and channel based I/O System was introduced. Java 1.5 was called J2SE 5, it added following major new features: \u00b7 Generics \u00b7 Annotations \u00b7 Autoboxingand autounboxing \u00b7 Enumerations \u00b7 For-each Loop \u00b7 Varargs \u00b7 Static Import \u00b7 Formatted I/O \u00b7 Concurrency utilities On 13 November 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On 8 May 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core code free andopen-source, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright. December 2008, the latest release of the Java Standard Edition is 6 (J2SE). With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suite various types of platforms. Ex: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications. Nextmajor release was Java SE 7 which included many new changes like : \u00b7 NowString can be used to control Swith statement. \u00b7 MultiCatch Exception \u00b7 try-with-resourcestatement \u00b7 BinaryInteger Literals \u00b7 Underscorein numeric literals. JAVA released to the market in three categories J2SE (JAVA 2 Standard Edition), J2EE (JAVA 2 Enterprise Edition) and J2ME (JAVA 2 Micro/Mobile Edition). J2SE is basically used for developing client side applications/programs. J2EE is used for developing server side applications/programs. J2ME is used for developing Mobile/PDA applications/programs If you exchange the data between client and server programs (J2SE and J2EE), by default JAVA is having on internal support with a protocol called http.

For example, multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Precedence rules can be overridden by explicit parentheses. Precedence order When two operators share an operand the operator with the higher precedence goes first. For example, 1 + 2 * 3 is treated as 1 + (2 * 3), whereas 1 * 2 + 3 is treated as (1 * 2) + 3 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition. Associativity When an expression has two operators with the same precedence, the expression is evaluated according to its associativity. For example x = y = z = 17 is treated as x = (y = (z = 17)), leaving all three variables with the value 17, since the = operator has right-to-left associativity (and an assignment statement evaluates to the value on the right hand side). On the other hand, 72 / 2 / 3 is treated as (72 / 2) / 3 since the / operator has left-to-right associativity. Precedence and associativity of Java operators The table below shows all Java operators from highest to lowest precedence, along with their associativity. Most programmers do not memorize them all, and even those that do still use parentheses for clarity. Order of evaluation of subexpressions Associativity and precedence determine in which order Java applies operators to subexpressions but they do not determine in which order the subexpressions are evaluated. In Java, subexpressions are evaluated from left to right (when there is a choice). So, for example in the expression A() + B() * C(D(), E()), the subexpressions are evaluated in the order A(), B(), D(), E(), and C(). Although, C() appears to the left of both D() and E(), we need the results of both D() and E() to evaluate C(). It is considered poor style to write code that relies upon this behavior (and different programming languages may use different rules). Short circuiting When using the conditional and and or operators (&& and ||), Java does not evaluate the second operand unless it is necessary to resolve the result. This allows statements like if (s != null && s.length() < 10) to work reliably. Programmers rarely use the non short-circuiting versions (& and |) with boolean expressions. Precedence order gone awry Sometimes the precedence order defined in a language do not conform with mathematical norms. For example, in Microsoft Excel, -a^b is interpreted as (-a)^b instead of -(a^b). So -1^2 is equal to 1 instead of -1, which is the values most mathematicians would expect. Microsoft acknowledges this quirk as a \"design choice\". One wonders whether the programmer was relying on the C precedence order in which unary operators have higher precedence than binary operators. This rule agrees with mathematical conventions for all C operators, but fails with the addition of the exponentiation operator. Once the order was established in Microsoft Excel 2.0, it could not easily be changed without breaking backward compatibility. Operator Description Level Associativity [] .

See the following example for, How it converts\u2026 /* Java program to illustrate autoboxing */ `` import ` ` java . io .*; `` import ` ` java . util .*; ` ` class ` ` GFG `` { `` `` public ` ` static ` ` void ` ` main ( String [] args ) `` `` { `` `` /* Here we are creating a list of elements`` ``of Integer type.

Important point in the program is that the operators remainder (%) and unary plus (+=) operators do not apply to Integer objects. But still code compiles successfully because the unboxing of Integer Object to primitive int value is taking place by invoking intValue() method at runtime. //Java program to illustrate find sum of odd numbers using autobxing and unboxing import java.io.* ; import java.util.* ; class GFG { public static int sumOfOddNumber ( List < Integer > list ) { int sum = 0 ; for ( Integer i : list ) { // unboxing of i automatically if ( i % 2 != 0 ) sum += i ; /* unboxing of i is done automatically using intvalue implicitly */ if ( i . intValue () % 2 != 0 ) sum += i . intValue (); } return sum ; } public static void main ( String [] args ) { /* Here we are creating a list of elements of Integer type and adding the int primitives type values to the list*/ List < Integer > list = new ArrayList < Integer >(); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++) list . add ( i ); // getting sum of all odd no. in the list. int sumOdd = sumOfOddNumber ( list ); System . out . println ( \"Sum of odd numbers = \" + sumOdd ); } } Output: Sum of odd numbers = 25 Advantages of Autoboxing / Unboxing: Autoboxing and Unboxing lets developers write cleaner code, making it easier to read.

There are two types of casting. Primitive Casting : When the data is casted from one primitive type ( like int, float, double etc\u2026 ) to another primitive type, then it is called Primitive Casting. Derived Casting : When the data is casted from one derived type to another derived type, then it is called derived casting. What is auto widening and explicit narrowing.? The data is implicitly casted from small sized primitive type to big sized primitive type. This is called auto-widening. i.e The data is automatically casted from byte to short, short to int, int to long, long to float and float to double. You have to explicitly cast the data from big sized primitive type to small sized primitive type. i.e you have to explicitly convert the data from double to float, float to long, long to int, int to short and short to byte This is called explicit narrowing. What is auto-up casting and explicit down casting.? An object of sub class type can be automatically casted to super class type. This is called auto-up casting. An object of super class type should be explicitly casted to sub class type, It is called explicit down casting. Can an int primitive type of data implicitly casted to Double derived type.? Yes, first int is auto-widened to double and then double is auto-boxed to Double. What is ClassCastException.? ClassCastException is an exception which occurs at run time when an object of one type can not be casted to another type. How do you avoid ClassCastException in your code.? By using generics, you can avoid ClassCastException. (Click here to see how you can avoid ClassCastException Using generics.) What is boxing and unboxing.? Wrapping of primitive content into corresponding wrapper class object is called boxing. Unwrapping the wrapper class object into corresponding primitive content is called un boxing. What is the difference between auto-widening, auto-upcasting and auto-boxing.?** Auto-widening occurs when small sized primitive type is casted to big sized primitive type. Auto-up casting occurs when sub class type is casted to super class type. Auto-boxing occurs when primitive type is casted to corresponding wrapper class.

Inheritance and polymorphism: super class and subclass, protected members, Relationship between super and sub class. Inheritance hierarchy, abstract classes and methods, final methods and classes, nested classes, Type wrappers. Constructors Link The general rule is that when a subclass is created Java will call the superclass constructor first and then call the subclass constructors in the order determined by the inheritance hierarchy If a superclass does not have a default constructor with no arguments, the subclass must explicitly call the superclass constructor with the appropriate arguments Inheritance Link Introduction Link Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties methods and fields of another. With the use of inheritance, the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order. Inheritance is the process of taking the features(data members + methods) from one class to another class. The class which giving the features is known asbase/parent class/super class. The class which is taking the features is known as derived/child/sub class. Instance is known as sub classing or derivation or extend-able classes or re usability. Advantages of Inheritance Link Application development time is very less.

We can achieve the slogan write one\u2019s reuse/run any where (WORA) of JAVA. Achieve oops inheritance concepts. inheritance is transitive. In Java, all methods except of constructors override the methods of their ancestor class by replacement. If a method is declared with the final modifier, it cannot be overridden. Types of Inheritance Link Reusable techniques Based on taking the features from base class to the derived class, in JAVA we have five types of inheritances. They are as follows: Single Inheritance Multilevel Inheritance Hierarchical Inheritance Multiple Inheritance Hybrid Inheritance Single Inheritance Link Single Inheritance is one in which there exists single base class and single derived class. Multi-level inheritance Link Multi-level inheritance is one which there exist single base class, single derived class and n number of intermediate base classes. An intermediate base class is one, in one context it acts as bass class and in another context it acts as derived class. Why multiple inheritance is not supported in Java. Link To remove ambiguity. To provide more maintainable and clear design. Extends Keyword Link Extends is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class. Below given is the syntax of extends keyword. class Super { Statements ; } class Sub extends Super { Statements ; } e . g . class Calculation { int z ; public void addition ( int x , int y ) { z = x + y ; System . out . println ( \"The sum of the given numbers:\" + z ); } public void Substraction ( int x , int y ) { z = x - y ; System . out . println ( \"The difference between the given numbers:\" + z ); } } public class My_Calculation extends Calculation { public void multiplication ( int x , int y ) { z = x * y ; System . out . println ( \"The product of the given numbers:\" + z ); } public static void main ( String args []) { int a = 20 , b = 10 ; My_Calculation demo = new My_Calculation (); demo . addition ( a , b ); demo . Substraction ( a , b ); demo . multiplication ( a , b ); } } The Superclass reference variable can hold the subclass object, but using that variable you can access only the members of the superclass, so to access the members of both classes it is recommended to always create reference variable to the subclass. If you consider the above program you can instantiate the class as given below as well. But using the superclass reference variable ( cal in this case ) you cannot call the method multiplication, which belongs to the subclass My_Calculation. Note: A subclass inherits all the members fields, methods, and nested classes from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass. The Superclass reference variable can hold the subclass object, but using that variable you can access only the members of the superclass, so to access the members of both classes it is recommended to always create reference variable to the subclass.

Note : A subclass inherits all the members fields, methods, and nested classes from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass. Super keyword Link In Java, super keyword is used to refer to immediate parent class of a class. In other words super keyword is used by a subclass whenever it need to refer to its immediate super class. The super keyword is similar to this keyword following are the scenarios where the super keyword is used. It is used to differentiate the members of superclass from the members of subclass, if they have same names. It is used to invoke the superclass constructor from subclass. Differentiating the members Link If a class is inheriting the properties of another class. And if the members of the superclass have the names same as the sub class, to differentiate these variables we use super keyword as shown below. super . variable super . method (); e . g . class Super_class { int num = 20 ; //display method of superclass public void display () { System . out . println ( \"This is the display method of superclass\" ); } } public class Sub_class extends Super_class { int num = 10 ; //display method of sub class public void display () { System . out . println ( \"This is the display method of subclass\" ); } public void my_method () { //Instantiating subclass Sub_class sub = new Sub_class (); //Invoking the display() method of sub class sub . display (); //Invoking the display() method of superclass super . display (); //printing the value of variable num of subclass System . out . println ( \"value of the variable named num in sub class:\" + sub . num ); //printing the value of variable num of superclass System . out . println ( \"value of the variable named num in super class:\" + super . num ); } public static void main ( String args []) { Sub_class obj = new Sub_class (); obj . my_method (); } } ``` Invoking Superclass constructor Link If a class is inheriting the properties of another class, the subclass automatically acquires the default constructor of the super class. But if you want to call a parametrized constructor of the super class, you need to use the super keyword as shown below. super ( values ); e . g . class Superclass { int age ; Superclass ( int age ) { this . age = age ; } public void getAge () { System . out . println ( \"The value of the variable named age in super class is: \" + age ); } } public class Subclass extends Superclass { Subclass ( int age ) { super ( age ); } public static void main ( String argd []) { Subclass s = new Subclass ( 24 ); s . getAge (); } } IS-A Relationship Link IS-A is a way of saying : This object is a type of that object. Let us see how the extends keyword is used to achieve inheritance. public class Animal {} public class Mammal extends Animal {} public class Reptile extends Animal {} public class Dog extends Mammal {} With use of the extends keyword the subclasses will be able to inherit all the properties of the superclass except for the private properties of the superclass. Instanceof Keyword Link Let us use the instanceof operator to check determine whether Mammal is actually an Animal, and dog is actually an Animal Can you use both this() and super() in a Constructor? Link NO, because both super() and this() must be first statement inside a constructor. Hence we cannot use them together. Difference between Overloading and Overriding Link Properties Overloading Overriding Overloading deals with multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different signatures Overriding deals with two methods, one in a parent class and one in a child class, that have the same signature Overloading lets you define a similar operation in different ways for different data Overriding lets you define a similar operation in different ways for different object types Controlling inheritance Link Visibility modifiers determine which class members are accessible and which do not Members (variables and methods) declared with publicvisibility are accessible, and those with private visibility are not Problem: How to make class/instance variables visible only to its subclasses? Solution: Java provides a third visibility modifier that helps in inheritance situations: protected Polymorphism Link Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic. In Java, all Java objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the IS-A test for their own type and for the class Object. It is important to know that the only possible way to access an object is through a reference variable. A reference variable can be of only one type. Once declared, the type of a reference variable cannot be changed. The reference variable can be reassigned to other objects provided that it is not declared final. The type of the reference variable would determine the methods that it can invoke on the object. A reference variable can refer to any object of its declared type or any subtype of its declared type. A reference variable can be declared as a class or interface type. Polymorphism means one name, manyforms. There are 3 distinct forms of Java Polymorphism; Method overloading (Compile time polymorphism) Method overriding through inheritance (Run time polymorphism) Method overriding through the Java interface (Run time polymorphism) Polymorphism allows a referenceto denote objects of different types at different times during execution. Asuper type reference exhibits polymorphic behavior, since it can denote objectsof its subtypes. interface Shape { public double area (); public double volume (); } class Cube implements Shape { int x = 10 ; public double area ( ) { return ( 6 * x * x ); } public double volume () { return ( x * x * x ); } } class Circle implements Shape { int radius = 10 ; public double area () { return ( Math . PI * radius * radius ); } public double volume () { return 0 ; } } public class PolymorphismTest { public static void main ( String args []) { Shape [] s = { new Cube (), new Circle () }; for ( int i = 0 ; i < s . length ; i ++) { System . out . println ( \"The area and volume of \" + s [ i ]. getClass () + \" is \" + s [ i ]. area () + \" , \" + s [ i ]. volume ()); } } } //Output The area and volume of class Cube is 600.0 , 1000.0 The area and volume of class Circle is 314.1592653589793 , 0.0 The methods area() and volume() are overridden in the implementingclasses. The invocation of the both methods area and volume is determined basedon run time polymorphism of the current object as shown in the output. Wrapper Classes Link Vectors cannot handle primitive datatypes like int, float,long, char, and double. Primitive data types may be converted into object typesusing the wrapper classes contained in the java.lang.package. The following table gives the details about those classes andmethods used for converting storing data to fundamental data: DATA TYPES WRAPPER CLASS CONVERTION METHOD FROM STRING DATA TO FUNDAMENTAL DATA TYPE Converting Object Numbers to Primitive Number Using typeValue() method byte Byte public static byte parseByte (string) short Short public static short parseShort (string) int Integer public static int parseInt (string) int i = IntVal.intValue(); long Long public static long parseLong (string) Long i = LongVal.longValue(); float Float public static float parseFloat (string) float i = FloatVal.floatValue(); double Double public static double parseDouble (string) double i = DoubleVal.doubletValue(); char Char public static char parseChar (string) boolean Boolean public static boolean parseBoolean(string) Wrapper classes are basically used for converting the string data into fundamental data type. Each and every wrapper class contains the following generalized parse methods. public static Xxx parseXxx (String); here, Xxx represents fundamental data type. The wrapper classes have a number of unique methods for handling primitive data types and objects Whenever we develop a JAVA program it is recommended to write \u2018n\u2019 number of business logic classes and single execution logic class. A business logic class is one which contains \u2018n\u2019 number of user defined methods in which we write business logic. Business logic is one which is provided by JAVA programmer according business rules (requirements) started by customer. Whatever data we represent in JAVA runtime environment it is by default treated as objects of string data. As a programmer when we start any JAVA program an object of string class is created depends on number of values we pass.","title":"Unit II"},{"location":"java/UnitII/#unit-ii","text":"Classes & Objects: Class fundamentals, declaring object reference variable, Introducing methods, constructors, the key word, garbage collection, Overloading methods.

The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic. In Java, all Java objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the IS-A test for their own type and for the class Object. It is important to know that the only possible way to access an object is through a reference variable. A reference variable can be of only one type. Once declared, the type of a reference variable cannot be changed. The reference variable can be reassigned to other objects provided that it is not declared final. The type of the reference variable would determine the methods that it can invoke on the object. A reference variable can refer to any object of its declared type or any subtype of its declared type. A reference variable can be declared as a class or interface type. Polymorphism means one name, manyforms. There are 3 distinct forms of Java Polymorphism; Method overloading (Compile time polymorphism) Method overriding through inheritance (Run time polymorphism) Method overriding through the Java interface (Run time polymorphism) Polymorphism allows a referenceto denote objects of different types at different times during execution. Asuper type reference exhibits polymorphic behavior, since it can denote objectsof its subtypes. interface Shape { public double area (); public double volume (); } class Cube implements Shape { int x = 10 ; public double area ( ) { return ( 6 * x * x ); } public double volume () { return ( x * x * x ); } } class Circle implements Shape { int radius = 10 ; public double area () { return ( Math .

Introduction to String Handling String is probably the most commonly used class in java library. String class is encapsulated under java.lang package. In java, every string that you create is an object of type String. One important thing to notice about string object is that string objects are immutable that means once a string object is created it cannot be altered. An object of the String class represents a string of characters. Literal Strings : Literal strings are anonymous constant objects of the String class that are defined as text in double quotes.

Anobject whose state cannot changed afterit is created is known as an Immutable object. String, Integer, Byte, Short,Float, Double and all other wrapper class's objects are immutable. Immutableobjects are convenient because several references can point to the same objectsafely: there is no danger of changing an object through one reference withoutthe others being aware of the change. Creating an Immutableclass publicfinal class MyString { final String str ; MyString ( String s ) { this . str = s ; } public String get () { return str ;* } } Inthis example MyString is an immutable class. MyString's state cannot be changedonce it is created. Creating a String object Stringcan be created in number of ways, here are a few ways of creating stringobject. Using a Stringliteral: String literal is a simple string enclosed in double quotes \"\" . A string literal is treated as a Sting object. String str1 = \"Hello\" ; Using anotherString object: String str2 = new String ( str1 ); 3. *Using new Keyword:* String str3 = new String ( \"Java\" ); Using +operator (Concatenation) String str4 = str1 + str2 ; * or , * String str5 = \"hello\" + \"Java\" ; Eachtime you create a String literal, the JVM checks the string pool first. If thestring literal already exists in the pool, a reference to the pool instance is returned.If string does not exist in the pool, a new string object is created,and is placed in the pool. String objects are stored in a special memory areaknown as string constant pool inside the heap memory. String object and How theyare stored Whenwe create a new string object using string literal, that string literal isadded to the string pool, if it is not presentthere already. Stringstr = \"Hello\" ; And,when we create another object with same string, then a reference of the stringliteral already present in stringpool is returned. Stringstr2 = str ;* Butif we change the new string, its reference gets modified. str2 = str2 . concat ( \"world\" ); Concatenating String Thereare 2 methods to concatenate two or more string. Using concat()method Using + operator **1. ****Using concat()method: ** string s = \"Hello\" ; string str = \"Java\" ; string str2 = s . concat ( str ); String str1 = \"Hello\" . concat ( \"Java\" ); //works with string literals too 2. ****Using +operator * string str = \"Rahul\" ;* * string str1 = \"Dravid\" ;* * string str2 = str + str1 ;* * string st = \"Rahul\" + \"Dravid\" ;* String Comparison Stringcomparison can be done in 3 ways. Using equals()method Using ==operator By CompareTo()method **Using equals() method: **equals() methodcompares two strings for equality. Its general syntax is, boolean equals(Object str). It compares the content of the strings. It will return true ifstring matches, else returns false. String s = \"Hell\" ; String s1 = \"Hello\" ; String s2 = \"Hello\" ; s1 . equals ( s2 ); //true s . equals ( s1 ) ; //false 2. Using == operator == operator compares two object references tocheck whether they refer to same instance. This also, will return true onsuccessful match. String s1 = \"Java\" ; String s2 = \"Java\" ; String s3 = new string ( \"Java\" ); test ( Sl == s2 ) //true test ( s1 == s3 ) //false 3. ****By compareTo()method: **compareTo()method compares values and returns an int which tells if the string compared isless than, equal to or greater than th other string.

The String class has an equivalent class method,format(), that returns a String object rather than a PrintStream object. UsingString's static format() method allows you to create a formatted string thatyou can reuse, as opposed to a one-time print statement. For example, insteadof: System.out.printf(\"Thevalue of the float variable is \"+ \"%f, while the value of the integer\"+ \"variable is %d, and the string \"+ \"is %s\", floatVar,intVar, stringVar); youcan write: Stringfs; fs =String.format(\"Thevalue of the float variable is \"+\"%f, while the value of the integer\"+\"variable is %d, and the string \"+\"is %s\", floatVar,intVar, stringVar); System.out.println(fs)** StringBuffer class Link StringBufferclass is used to create a mutable string object. It represents growable andwritable character sequence.As we know that String objects are immutable, so if we do a lot of changes withString objects, we willend up with a lot of memory leak. So StringBuffer class is used when we have tomake lot of modifications to our string. It is also thread safe i.e multiplethreads cannot access it simultaneously. StringBuffer defines 4 constructors.They are, StringBuffer () StringBuffer (int size ) StringBuffer (String str ) StringBuffer (charSequence [ ]ch ) StringBuffer()creates an empty string buffer and reserves room for 16 characters. stringBuffer(intsize) creates an empty string and takes an integer argument to set capacity ofthe buffer. Example showing differencebetween String and StringBuffer class Test { public static void main(String args[]) { String str = \"study\"; str.concat(\"tonight\"); System.out.println(str); // Output: study StringBuffer strB = newStringBuffer(\"study\"); strB.append(\"tonight\"); System.out.println(strB); // Output: studytonight } } Important methods ofStringBuffer class Thefollowing methods are some most commonly used methods of StringBuffer class. append() . This method will concatenatethe string representation of any type of data to the end of the invoking StringBufferobject. append() method has several overloaded forms. StringBufferappend(String str) StringBufferappend(int n) StringBufferappend(Object obj) Thestring representation of each parameter is appended to StringBuffer object. StringBufferstr = new StringBuffer(\"test\"); str.append(123); System.out.println(str); Output: test123 insert(): **This methodinserts one string into another. Here are few forms of insert() method.** StringBufferinsert(int index, String str) StringBufferinsert(int index, int num) StringBufferinsert(int index, Object obj) Herethe first parameter gives the index at which position the string will beinserted and string representation of second parameter is inserted intoStringBuffer object. StringBufferstr = new StringBuffer(\"test\"); str.insert(4,123); System.out.println(str); Output: test123 reverse(): **This methodreverses the characters within a StringBuffer object.** StringBufferstr = new StringBuffer(\"Hello\"); str.reverse(); System.out.println(str); Output: olleH replace(): **This methodreplaces the string from specified start index to the end index.** StringBufferstr = new StringBuffer(\"Hello World\"); str.replace(6, 11, \"java\"); System.out.println(str); Output: Hello java **capacity(): **This methodreturns the current capacity of StringBuffer object. StringBufferstr = new StringBuffer(); System.out.println(str.capacity() ); Output: 16 ensureCapacity(): **This method isused to ensure minimum capacity of StringBuffer object. StringBuffer str = new StringBuffer(\"hello\");** str.ensureCapacity(10); String Builder Link StringBuilderis identical to StringBuffer except for one important difference it is notsynchronized, which means it is not thread safe. Its because StringBuildermethods are not synchronised. StringBuilder Constructors StringBuilder (), creates an empty StringBuilder and reserves room for 16 characters. StringBuilder (int size ), create an empty string and takes an integer argument to setcapacity of the buffer. StringBuilder (String str ), create a StringBuilder object and initialize it with string str. Difference betweenStringBuffer and StringBuilder class StringBuffer class StringBuilder class StringBuffer is synchronized. StringBuilder is not synchronized. Because of synchronisation, StringBuffer operation is slower than StringBuilder. StringBuilder operates faster.

Thread priorities, synchronization, Inter thread communications, suspending resuming and stopping thread using multi threading. Exception handling: Exception handling fundamentals Introduction Link Thread Link A program can be divided into a number of smallprocesses. Each small process can be addressed as a single thread (alightweight process). Multithreaded programs contain two or more threads thatcan run concurrently.A flow of control is known as thread. If a program contains multiple flow of controlsfor achieving concurrent execution, then that program is known asmulti-threaded program. A program is said to be a multithreaded programif and only if in which there exist n number of subprograms there exist aseparate flow of control. All such flow of control executing concurrently suchflow of controls are known as threads and such type of applications or programis called multi-threaded programs. The language like C, C++ comes under singlethreaded modelling languages, since there exists single flow of controlswhereas the language like java are treated as multi-threaded modellinglanguages, since there is a possibility of creating multiple flow of control In java program, there exist two threads theyare foreground and background thread. Foreground threads are those which are executinguser defined sub programs where as background threads are those which aremonitoring the status of foreground threads. There is possibility of creating n-number of foregroundthreads and always there exist single background thread. Multithreading is the specialized form ofmultitasking of operating system. In information technology, we can develop two types of applications. They are process based applications and thread based applications. S.No. Process Based Applications Thread Based Applications 1 It is the one in which there exist single flow of control. It is the one in which there exist multiple flow of controls. 2 All C, C++ applications comes under it. All JAVA, DOT NET applications comes under it. 3 Context switch is more (context switch is the concept of operating system and it says switching the control from one address page to another address page). Context switch is very less. 4 For each and every sub-program there exist separate address pages. Irrespective of \u2018n\u2019 number of subprograms there exist single address page. 5 These are treated as heavy weight components. These are treated as light weight components. 6 In this we can achieve only sequential execution and they are not recommending for developing internet applications. In thread based applications we can achieve both sequential and concurrent execution and they are always recommended for developing interact applications. How Thread executes internally A program can perform two or more tasks simultaneously. For example, one thread is writing content on a file at the same time another thread is performing spelling check.**** In Java, the word thread means two different things.**** 1. **An instance of Thread class. or,** 2. **A thread of execution.** An instance of Thread class is just an object, like anyother object in java. But a thread of execution means an**** individual \"lightweight\" process that has its owncall stack. In java, each thread has its own call stack.**** A program can be divided into a number of small processes. Each small process can be addressed as a single thread (a lightweight process). Multi-threaded programs contain two or more threads that can run concurrently. This means that a single program can perform two or more tasks simultaneously. For example, one thread is writing content on a file at the same time another thread is performing spelling check.Java is a multi threaded programming language which means we can develop multi threaded program using Java. A multi threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently and each part can handle different task at the same time making optimal use of the available resources specially when your computer has multiple CPUs. By definition multitasking is when multiple processes share common processing resources such as a CPU. Multi threading extends the idea of multitasking into applications where you can subdivide specific operations within a single application into individual threads. Each of the threads can run in parallel. The OS divides processing time not only among different applications, but also among each thread within an application. Multi threading enables you to write in a way where multiple activities can proceed concurrently in the same program. Life Cycle of a Thread(State of Thread) Link When we write any multi-threading applications, there exist \u2018n\u2019 numbers of threads. All the threads will undergo different types of states. A thread goes through various stages in its life cycle. For example, a thread is born, started, runs, and then dies. Following diagram shows complete life cycle of a thread. A thread goes through various stages in its life cycle. For example, a thread is born, started, runs, and then dies. Following diagram shows complete life cycle of a thread. Above-mentioned stages are explained here: New State : A new thread begins its life cycle in the new state. It remains in this state until the program starts the thread. It is also referred to as a born thread. **Ready State : **It is one in which the thread is entered into memory space allocated and it is waiting for CPU for executing. Runnable : After a newly born thread is started, the thread becomes runnable. A thread in this state is considered to be executing its task. Running state : A state is said to be a running state if and only if the thread is under the control of CPU. Waiting State: Sometimes, a thread transitions to the waiting state while the thread waits for another thread to perform a task.A thread transitions back to the runnable state only when another thread signals the waiting thread to continue executing.It is one in which the thread is waiting becauseof the following factors: For the repeating CPU, burst time of the thread(CPU burst time is an amount of the required by the thread by the CPU). Make the thread to sleep for sleep for some specified amount of time. Make the thread to suspend. Make the thread to wait for a period of time. Make the thread to wait without specifying waiting time Timed waiting: A runnable thread can enter the timed waiting state for a specified interval of time. A thread in this state transitions back to the runnable state when that time interval expires or when the event it is waiting for occurs. Halted State or Terminated Dead: A runnable thread enters the terminated state when it completes its task or otherwise terminates.It is one in which the thread has completed its total execution. As long as the thread is in new and halted states whose execution status is false whereas when the thread is in ready, running and waiting states that execution states is true. Thread Priorities Link Every Java thread has a priority that helps the operating system determine the order in which threads are scheduled. Java thread priorities are in the range between MIN_PRIORITY aconstantof1 and MAX_PRIORITY aconstantof10. By default, every thread is given priority NORM_PRIORITY aconstantof5. Threads with higher priority are more important to a program and should be allocated processor time before lower-priority threads. However, thread priorities cannot guarantee the order in which threads execute and very much platform dependent. public static final int MAX_PRIORITY (10); public static final int MIN_PRIORITY (1); public static final int NORM_PRIORITY (5); The above data members are used for setting the priority to threads are created. By default, whenever a thread is created whose default priority NORM_PRIORITY. Creating Thread Link Java defines two ways by which a thread can be created. By extending the Thread class( java.lang.Thread ). By implementing the Runnable interface(**java.lang.Runnable **). \u200b Create Thread by Implementing Runnable Interface Link If your class is intended to be executed as a thread then you can achieve this by implementing Runnable interface. You will need to follow three basic steps: Step 1: As a first step you need to implement a run method provided by Runnable interface. This method provides entry point for the thread and you will put you complete business logic inside this method. Following is simple syntax of run method: public void run( ) Step 2: At second step you will instantiate a Thread object using the following constructor: Thread(Runnable threadObj, String threadName); Where, threadObj is an instance of a class that implements the Runnable interface and threadName is the name given to the new thread. Step 3 Once Thread object is created, you can start it by calling start method, which executes a call to run method. Following is simple syntax of start method: void start( ); Example: Here is an example that creates a new thread and starts it running : class RunnableDemo implements Runnable { private Thread t ; private String threadName ; RunnableDemo ( String name ){ threadName = name ; System . out . println ( \"Creating \" + threadName ); } public void run () { System . out . println ( \"Running \" + threadName ); try { for ( int i = 4 ; i > 0 ; i --) { System . out . println ( \"Thread: \" + threadName + \", \" + i ); // Let the thread sleep for a while. Thread . sleep ( 50 ); } } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { System . out . println ( \"Thread \" + threadName + \" interrupted.\" ); } System . out . println ( \"Thread \" + threadName + \" exiting.\" ); } public void start () { System . out . println ( \"Starting \" + threadName ); if ( t == null ) { t = new Thread ( this , threadName ); t . start (); } } } public class TestThread { public static void main ( String args []) { RunnableDemo R1 = new RunnableDemo ( \"Thread-1\" ); R1 . start (); RunnableDemo R2 = new RunnableDemo ( \"Thread-2\" ); R2 . start (); } } This would produce the following result : Creating Thread - 1 Starting Thread - 1 Creating Thread - 2 Starting Thread - 2 Running Thread - 1 Thread: Thread - 1 , 4 Running Thread - 2 Thread: Thread - 2 , 4 Thread: Thread - 1 , 3 Thread: Thread - 2 , 3 Thread: Thread - 1 , 2 Thread: Thread - 2 , 2 Thread: Thread - 1 , 1 Thread: Thread - 2 , 1 Thread Thread - 1 exiting . Thread Thread - 2 exiting . Create Thread by Extending Thread Class: Link Thread class is the main class on which Java's Multithreading system is based. Thread class, along with its companion interface Runnable will be used to create and run threads for utilizing Multithreading feature of Java. Thread class is the main class on which Java's Multithreading system is based. Creating a flow of control in JAVA is nothing but creating an object of java.lang.Thread class. An object of Thread class can be created in three ways. They are: Directly Thread t=new Thread (); Using factory method Thread t1=Thread.currentThread (); Using sub-class of Thread class class C1 extends Thread { \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ; \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ; }; C1 o1 = new C1 (); Threadt1 = new C1 (); Here, C1 is the sub-class ofThread class. Thread API: Constructors of Thread class Thread ( ) Thread ( String str ) Thread ( Runnable r ) Thread ( Runnable r, String str) Thread () : With this Constructor, we can create an object of the Thread class whose default thread name is Thread-0. For example: Thread t=new Thread (); System.out.println (t.getName ());// Thread-0 Thread (String str) : This Constructor is used for creating a thread and we can give the user specified thread name. For example: Thread t=new Thread (\u201cJAVA\u201d); t.setName (\u201cJAVA\u201d); t.setPriority (Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); Thread (Runnable r): This Constructor is used for converting Runnable object into Thread object for entering into run method of Runnable interface by making use of start method of Thread class without giving thread name. Thread (Runnable r, String str): This Constructor is similar to above Constructor but we give thread name through this Constructor. The second way to create a thread is to create a new class that extends Thread class using the following two simple steps. This approach provides more flexibility in handling multiple threads created using available methods in Thread class. Step 1 You will need to override run method available in Thread class. This method provides entry point for the thread and you will put you complete business logic inside this method. Following is simple syntax of run method: public void run ( ) Step 2 Once Thread object is created, you can start it by calling start method, which executes a call to run method. Following is simple syntax of start method: void start ( ); Example: Here is the preceding program rewritten to extend Thread : class ThreadDemo extends Thread { private Thread t ; private String threadName ; ThreadDemo ( String name ){ threadName = name ; System . out . println ( \"Creating \" + threadName ); } public void run () { System . out . println ( \"Running \" + threadName ); try { for ( int i = 4 ; i > 0 ; i --) { System . out . println ( \"Thread: \" + threadName + \", \" + i ); // Let the thread sleep for a while. Thread . sleep ( 50 ); } } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { System . out . println ( \"Thread \" + threadName + \" interrupted.\" ); } System . out . println ( \"Thread \" + threadName + \" exiting.\" ); } public void start () { System . out . println ( \"Starting \" + threadName ); if ( t == null ) { t = new Thread ( this , threadName ); t . start (); } } } public class TestThread { public static void main ( String args []) { ThreadDemo T1 = new ThreadDemo ( \"Thread-1\" ); T1 . start (); ThreadDemo T2 = new ThreadDemo ( \"Thread-2\" ); T2 . start (); } } This would produce the following result : Creating Thread - 1 Starting Thread - 1 Creating Thread - 2 Starting Thread - 2 Running Thread - 1 Thread: Thread - 1 , 4 Running Thread - 2 Thread: Thread - 2 , 4 Thread: Thread - 1 , 3 Thread: Thread - 2 , 3 Thread: Thread - 1 , 2 Thread: Thread - 2 , 2 Thread: Thread - 1 , 1 Thread: Thread - 2 , 1 Thread Thread - 1 exiting . Thread Thread - 2 exiting . Thread Methods: Link Following is the list of important methods available in the Thread class. Instance Method Link public void start() : Starts the thread in a separate path of execution, then invokes the run method on this Thread object. This is the method which is used for making the Thread to start to execute the thread logic. The method start is internally calling the method run (). For example: Thread t1=new Thread (); t1.start (); Thread t2=Thread.currentThread (); t2.start (); public final void suspend (): This method is used for suspending the thread from current execution of thread. When the thread is suspended, it sends to waiting state by keeping the temporary results in process control block (PCB) or job control block (JCB). public void run() : If this Thread object was instantiated using a separate Runnable target, the run method is invoked on that Runnable object. Any JAVA programmer want to define a logic for the thread that logic must be defined only run () method. When the thread is started, the JVM looks for the appropriate run () method for executing the logic of the thread. Thread class is a concrete class and it contains all defined methods and all these methods are being to final except run () method. run () method is by default contains a definition with null body. Since we are providing the logic for the thread in run () method. Hence it must be overridden by extending Thread class into our own class. For example: class C1 extends Thread { public void run () { \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026; \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026; } }; public final void setName(String name) : Changes the name of the Thread object. There is also a getName method for retrieving the name. public final void setPriority(int priority): Sets the priority of this Thread object. The possible values are between 1 and 10. public final int getPriority (); The above two methods are used for setting the priority to the thread and getting the priority of the thread respectively. For example: Thread t1=new Thread (); Int pri=t1.getPriority (); System.out.println (pri);// 5 by default t1.setPriority (Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); pri=t1.getPriority (); System.out.println (pri); // 10 public final void setDaemon(booleanon) : A parameter of true denotes this Thread as a daemon thread. public final void join(long millisec) : The current thread invokes this method on a second thread, causing the current thread to block until the second thread terminates or the specified number of milliseconds passes. public void interrupt() : Interrupts this thread, causing it to continue execution if it was blocked for any reason. public final boolean isAlive(): Returns true if the thread is alive, which is any time after the thread has been started but before it runs to completion. public final void resume (): This method is used for bringing the suspended thread from waiting state to ready state. When the thread is resumed to start executing from where it left out previously by retrieving the previous result from PCB. public final void stop (): This method is used to stop the execution of the current thread and the thread goesto halted state from running state. When the thread is restarted, it starts executing from the beginning only. public final void wait (long msec): This method is used for making the currently executing thread into waiting state for a period of time. Once this period of time is over, automatically the waiting thread will enter into ready state from waiting state. Static Methods Link The previous methods are invoked on a particular Thread object. The following methods in the Thread class are static. Invoking one of the static methods performs the operation on the currently running thread. public static void yield() : Causes the currently running thread to yield to any other threads of the same priority that are waiting to be scheduled. public static void sleep(long millisec) : Causes the currently running thread to block for at least the specified number of milliseconds. This method throws InterruptedException method is used (waiting state). If the sleep time is over automatically thread will come from waiting state to ready state. For example: Thread.sleep (1000); public static boolean holds(LockObject x) : Returns true if the current thread holds the lock on the given Object. public static Thread(currentThread): Returns a reference to the currently running thread, which is the thread that invokes this method. This method is used for obtaining the threads which are running in the main memory of the computer. For example: Thread t=Thread.currentThread (); System.out.println (t);// Thread [main (fat), 5, main (bat)] public static void dump(Stack) : Prints the stack trace for the currently running thread, which is useful when debugging a multithreaded application. Some Important points to Remember When we extend Thread class, we cannot override setName() and getName() functions, because they are declared final in Thread class. While using sleep(), always handle the exception it throws. static void sleep(long milliseconds) throws InterruptedException Example: Write a JAVA program to findthe threads which are running internally and print priority values . Answer: class ThDemo { publicstatic void main ( String [] args ) { Threadt = Thread . currentThread (); System . out . println ( t ); t . setName ( \"ABC\" ); System . out . println ( t ); System . out . println ( \"IS IT ALIVE..?\" + t . isAlive ()); // true Threadt1 = new Thread (); // new state System . out . println ( \"IS IT ALIVE..?\" + t . isAlive ()); // false System . out . println ( \"DEFAULT NAME OF THREAD = \" + t1 . getName ()); // Thread-0 System . out . println ( \"MAXIMUM PRIORITY VALUE = \" + Thread . MAX_PRIORITY ); // 10 System . out . println ( \"MINIMUM PRIORITY VALUE = \" + Thread . MIN_PRIORITY ); // 1 System . out . println ( \"NORMAL PRIORITY VALUE = \" + Thread . NORM_PRIORITY ); // 5 } }; The following ThreadClassDemo program demonstrates some of these methods of the Thread class . Consider a class DisplayMessage which implements Runnable : // File Name : DisplayMessage.java // Create a thread to implement Runnable public class DisplayMessage implements Runnable { private String message ; public DisplayMessage ( String message ) { this . message = message ; } public void run () { while ( true ) { System . out . println ( message ); } } } Following is another class which extends Thread class: // File Name : GuessANumber.java // Create a thread to extentd Thread public class GuessANumber extends Thread { private int number ; public GuessANumber ( int number ) { this . number = number ; } public void run () { int counter = 0 ; int guess = 0 ; do { guess = ( int ) ( Math . random () * 100 + 1 ); System . out . println ( this . getName () - \" guesses \" + guess ); counter ++; } while ( guess != number ); - System . out . println ( \"** Correct! \" + this . getName () - \" in \" + counter + \" guesses.**\" ); } } Following is the main program which makes use of above defined classes: // File Name : ThreadClassDemo.java public class ThreadClassDemo { public static void main ( String [] args ) { Runnable hello = new DisplayMessage ( \"Hello\" ); Thread thread1 = new Thread ( hello ); thread1 . setDaemon ( true ); thread1 . setName ( \"hello\" ); System . out . println ( \"Starting hello thread...\" ); thread1 . start (); Runnable bye = new DisplayMessage ( \"Goodbye\" ); Thread thread2 = new Thread ( bye ); thread2 . setPriority ( Thread . MIN_PRIORITY ); thread2 . setDaemon ( true ); System . out . println ( \"Starting goodbye thread...\" ); thread2 . start (); System . out . println ( \"Starting thread3...\" ); Thread thread3 = new GuessANumber ( 27 ); thread3 . start (); try { thread3 . join (); } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { System . out . println ( \"Thread interrupted.\" ); } System . out . println ( \"Starting thread4...\" ); Thread thread4 = new GuessANumber ( 75 ); thread4 . start (); System . out . println ( \"main() is ending...\" ); } } This would produce the following result . You can try this example again and again and you would get different result every time . Starting hello thread ... Starting goodbye thread ... Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye ....... Major Java Multithreading Concepts: While doing Multithreading programming in Java, you would need to have the following concepts very handy: What is thread synchronization? Handling threads inter communication Handling thread deadlock Major thread operations Loading [MathJax]/jax/output/HTML-CSS/ja Joining Thread Link Sometimes one thread needs to know when another thread is ending. In java, isAlive() and join() are two different methods to check whether a thread has finished its execution. The isAlive() methods return true if the thread upon which it is called is still running otherwise it return false. final boolean isAlive() But, join() method is used more commonly than isAlive(). This method waits until the thread on which it is called terminates. final void join() throws InterruptedException Using join() method, we tell our thread to wait until the specifid thread completes its execution. There are overloaded versions of join() method, which allows us to specify time for which you want to wait for the specified thread to terminate. final void join(long milliseconds) throws InterruptedException Example of isAlive method public class MyThread extends Thread { public void run () { System . out . println ( \"r1 \" ); try { Thread . sleep ( 500 ); } catch ( InterruptedException ie ){} System . out . println ( \"r2 \" ); } public static void main ( String [] args ) { MyThread t1 = new MyThread (); MyThread t2 = new MyThread (); t1 . start (); t2 . start (); System . out . println ( t1 . isAlive ()); System . out . println ( t2 . isAlive ()); } } Output r1 true true r1 r2 r2 Example of thread without join () method public class MyThread extends Thread { public void run () { System . out . println ( \"r1 \" ); try { Thread . sleep ( 500 ); } catch ( InterruptedException ie ){} System . out . println ( \"r2 \" ); } public static void main ( String [] args ) { MyThread t1 = new MyThread (); MyThread t2 = new MyThread (); t1 . start (); t2 . start (); } } Output r1 r1 r2 r2 In this above program two thread t1 and t2 are created. t1 starts first and after printing \"r1\" on console thread t1 goes to sleep for 500 mls.At the same time Thread t2 will start its process and print \"r1\" on console and then goes into sleep for 500 mls. Thread t1 will wake up from sleep and print \"r2\" on console similarly thread t2 will wake up from sleep and print \"r2\" on console. So you will get output like r1 r1 r2 r2 Example of thread with join () method public class MyThread extends Thread { public void run () { System . out . println ( \"r1 \" ); try { Thread . sleep ( 500 ); } catch ( InterruptedException ie ){} System . out . println ( \"r2 \" ); } public static void main ( String [] args ) { MyThread t1 = new MyThread (); MyThread t2 = new MyThread (); t1 . start (); try { t1 . join (); //Waiting for t1 to finish } catch ( InterruptedException ie ){} t2 . start (); } } Output r1 r2 r1 r2 In this above program join() method on thread t1 ensure that t1 finishes it process before thread t2 starts. Specifying time with join() If in the above program, we specify time while using join() with m1, then m1 will execute for that time, and then m2 and m3 will join it. m1.join(1500); Doing so, initially m1 will execute for 1.5 seconds, after which m2 and m3 will join it. Synchronization Link At times when more than one thread try to access a shared resource, we need to ensure that resource will be used by only one thread at a time. The process by which this is achieved is called synchronization. The synchronization keyword in java creates a block of code referred to as critical section. Every Java object with a critical section of code gets a lock associated with the object. To enter critical section a thread need to obtain the corresponding object's lock. General Syntax : synchronized (object) { //statement to be synchronized } Why we use Syncronization ? If we do not use syncronization, and let two or more threads access a shared resource at the same time, it will lead to distorted results. Consider an example, Suppose we have two different threads T1 and T2, T1 starts execution and save certain values in a file temporary.txt which will be used to calculate some result when T1 returns. Meanwhile, T2 starts and before T1 returns, T2 change the values saved by T1 in the file temporary.txt (temporary.txt is the shared resource). Now obviously T1 will return wrong result. To prevent such problems, synchronization was introduced. With synchronization in above case, once T1 starts using temporary.txt file, this file will be locked(LOCK mode), and no other thread will be able to access or modify it until T1 returns. Using Synchronized Methods Using Synchronized methods is a way to accomplish synchronization. But lets first see what happens when we do not use synchronization in our program. Example with no Synchronization class First { public void display ( String msg ) { System . out . print ( \"[\" + msg ); try { Thread . sleep ( 1000 ); } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { e . printStackTrace (); } System . out . println ( \"]\" ); } } class Second extends Thread { String msg ; First fobj ; Second ( First fp , String str ) { fobj = fp ; msg = str ; start (); } public void run () { fobj . display ( msg ); } } public class Syncro { public static void main ( String [] args ) { First fnew = new First (); Second ss = new second ( fnew , \"welcome\" ); Second ss1 = new second ( fnew , \"new\" ); Second ss2 = new second ( fnew , \"programmer\" ); } } Output : [ welcome [ new [ programmer ] ] ] In the above program, object fnew of class First is shared by all the three running threads(ss, ss1 and ss2) to call the shared method(void display). Hence the result is unsynchronized and such situation is called Race condition. Synchronized Keyword Link To synchronize above program, we must serialize access to the shared display() method, making it available to only one thread at a time. This is done by using keyword synchronized with display() method. synchronized void display (String msg) Using Synchronised block Link If you have to synchronize access to object of a class that has no synchronized methods, and you cannot modify the code. You can use synchronized block to use it. class First { public void display ( String msg ) { System . out . print ( \"[\" + msg ); try { Thread . sleep ( 1000 ); } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { e . printStackTrace (); } System . out . println ( \"]\" ); } } class Second extends Thread { String msg ; First fobj ; Second ( First fp , String str ) { fobj = fp ; msg = str ; start (); } public void run () { synchronized ( fobj ) //Synchronized block { fobj . display ( msg ); } } } public class Syncro { public static void main ( String [] args ) { First fnew = new First (); Second ss = new second ( fnew , \"welcome\" ); Second ss1 = new second ( fnew , \"new\" ); Second ss2 = new second ( fnew , \"programmer\" ); } } Output : [ welcome ] [ new ] [ programmer ] Because of synchronized block this program gives the expected output. Inter Thread Communication Link If two or more threads are exchanging the data then that communication is known as inter thread communication. In inter thread communication; an output of one thread is given as an input to another thread. In order to develop inter thread communication applications we must make use of a class called java.lang.Object. Java provide benefit of avoiding thread pooling using inter thread communication. Methods in java.lang.Object: public void wait (long msec) public void wait (long msec, int nanosec) public void wait () public void notify () public void notifyAll () These methods are implemented as final in Object. All methods can be called only from within a synchronized context. wait() tells calling thread to give up monitor and go to sleep until some other thread enters the same monitor and call notify. notify() wakes up a thread that called wait() on same object. notifyAll() wakes up all the thread that called wait() on same object Difference between wait() and sleep() wait() sleep() called from synchronised block **** no such requirement**** monitor is released **** monitor is not released**** awake when notify() or notifyAll() method is called.**** not awake when notify() or notifyAll() method is called**** not a static method **** static method**** wait() is generally used on condition **** sleep() method is simply used to put your thread on sleep.**** Thread Pooling Link Pooling is usually implemented by loop i.e to check somecondition repeatedly. Once condition is true appropriate action is taken. This waste CPU time. Deadlock Link Deadlock is a situation of complete Lock, when no thread cancomplete its execution because lack of resources. In the above picture, Thread1 is holding a resource R1, and need another resource R2 to finish execution,but R2 is locked by Thread 2, which needs R3, which in turn is locked by Thread3.

Link No, a thread cannot be started twice. If you try to do so, IllegalThreadStateException will be thrown. public static void main( String args[] ) { MyThread mt = new MyThread(); mt.start(); mt.start(); //Exception thrown } When a thread is in running state, and you try to start it again, or any method try to invoke that thread again using start () method, exception is thrown. Exception Handling Link Java provides a neater, more structured alternative method for dealing with possible errors that can occur while a program is running. Exceptions are things that are not supposed to occur The word \u201cexception\u201d is meant to be more general than \u201cerror\u201d. Some exceptions (like division by zero) are avoidable through careful programming Some exceptions (like losing a network connection) are not avoidable or predictable Java allows programmers to define their own means of handling exceptions when they occur Exception Handling is the mechanism to handle runtime malfunctions. We need to handle such exceptions to prevent abrupt termination of program. The term exception means exceptional condition, it is a problem that may arise during the execution of program. A bunch of things can lead to exceptions, including programmer error, hardware failures, files that need to be opened cannot be found, resource exhaustion etc. Exception Link A Java Exception is an object that describes the exception that occurs in a program. When an exceptional events occurs in java, an exception is said to be thrown. The code that's responsible for doing something about the exception is called an exception handler. Exception class Hierarchy Link All exception types are subclasses of class Throwable, which is at the top of exception class hierarchy. Exception class is for exceptional conditions that program should catch. This class is extended to create user specific exception classes. RuntimeException is a subclass of Exception. Exceptions under this class are automatically defined for programs. Exception are categorized into 3 category. Link Checked Exception: The exception that can be predicted by the programmer.Example : File that need to be opened is not found. These type of exceptions must be checked at compile time. Unchecked Exception: Unchecked exceptions are the class that extends RuntimeException. Unchecked exception are ignored at compile time. Example : ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, Array Index out of Bound exception. Unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime. Error: Errors are typically ignored in code because you can rarely do anything about an error. Example : if stack overflow occurs, an error will arise. This type of error is not possible handle in code. Uncaught Exceptions Link When we don't handle the Exceptions, they lead to unexpected program termination. Lets take an example for better understanding. class UncaughtException { public static void main ( String args []) { int a = 0 ; int b = 7 / a ; // Divide by zero, will lead to exception } } This will lead to an exception at runtime, hence the Java run-time system will construct an exception and then throw it. As we don't have any mechanism for handling exception in the above program, hence the default handler will handle the exception and will print the details of the exception on the terminal. Finally Clause Link When exception is thrown control is transferred to method containing the catch block to handle the exception Control does not return to procedure in which the exception was thrown unless it contains a finally clause The finally clause can be used to clean up the programming environment after the exceptions has been handled Finally clause Example void n () { \u2026 try { \u2026 open window \u2026 p () \u2026 } catch ( SomeException se ) { \u2026 } finally { \u2026 close window \u2026 } \u2026 } void p () { \u2026 throw se \u2026 } Introduction An exception or exceptional event is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. When an Exception occurs the normal flow of the program is disrupted and the program/Application terminates abnormally, which is not recommended, therefore these exceptions are to be handled. An exception can occur for many different reasons, below given are some scenarios where exception occurs. A user has entered invalid data. A file that needs to be opened cannot be found. A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications or the JVM has run out of memory. Some of these exceptions are caused by user error, others by programmer error, and others by physical resources that have failed in some manner. Based on these we have three categories of Exceptions you need to understand them to know how exception handling works in Java, Checked exceptions: A checked exception is an exception that occurs at the compile time, these are also called as compile time exceptions. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored at the time of compilation, the Programmer should take care of handle these exceptions. For example, if you use FileReader class in your program to read data from a file, if the file specified in its constructor doesn't exist, then an FileNotFoundException occurs, and compiler prompts the programmer to handle the exception. import java.io.File ; import java.io.FileReader ; public class FilenotFound_Demo { public static void main ( String args []) { File file = new File ( \"E://file.txt\" ); FileReader fr = new FileReader ( file ); } } If you try to compile the above program you will get exceptions as shown below. FilenotFound_Demo.java:8: error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught or declared to be thrown FileReader fr = new FileReader(file); ^ 1 error Note: Since the methods read and close of FileReader class throws IOException, you can observe that compiler notifies to handle IOException, along with FileNotFoundException. Unchecked exceptions: An Unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution, these are also called as Runtime Exceptions, these include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation. For example, if you have declared an array of size 5 in your program, and trying to call the 6 th element of the array then an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionexception occurs.

A program is said to be a multithreaded programif and only if in which there exist n number of subprograms there exist aseparate flow of control. All such flow of control executing concurrently suchflow of controls are known as threads and such type of applications or programis called multi-threaded programs. The language like C, C++ comes under singlethreaded modelling languages, since there exists single flow of controlswhereas the language like java are treated as multi-threaded modellinglanguages, since there is a possibility of creating multiple flow of control In java program, there exist two threads theyare foreground and background thread.

In thread based applications we can achieve both sequential and concurrent execution and they are always recommended for developing interact applications. How Thread executes internally A program can perform two or more tasks simultaneously. For example, one thread is writing content on a file at the same time another thread is performing spelling check.**** In Java, the word thread means two different things.**** 1. **An instance of Thread class. or,** 2. **A thread of execution.** An instance of Thread class is just an object, like anyother object in java. But a thread of execution means an**** individual \"lightweight\" process that has its owncall stack. In java, each thread has its own call stack.**** A program can be divided into a number of small processes. Each small process can be addressed as a single thread (a lightweight process). Multi-threaded programs contain two or more threads that can run concurrently. This means that a single program can perform two or more tasks simultaneously. For example, one thread is writing content on a file at the same time another thread is performing spelling check.Java is a multi threaded programming language which means we can develop multi threaded program using Java. A multi threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently and each part can handle different task at the same time making optimal use of the available resources specially when your computer has multiple CPUs. By definition multitasking is when multiple processes share common processing resources such as a CPU. Multi threading extends the idea of multitasking into applications where you can subdivide specific operations within a single application into individual threads. Each of the threads can run in parallel. The OS divides processing time not only among different applications, but also among each thread within an application. Multi threading enables you to write in a way where multiple activities can proceed concurrently in the same program.","title":"Thread"},{"location":"java/UnitIV/#life-cycle-of-a-threadstate-of-thread","text":"When we write any multi-threading applications, there exist \u2018n\u2019 numbers of threads.

It is also referred to as a born thread. **Ready State : **It is one in which the thread is entered into memory space allocated and it is waiting for CPU for executing. Runnable : After a newly born thread is started, the thread becomes runnable. A thread in this state is considered to be executing its task.

Waiting State: Sometimes, a thread transitions to the waiting state while the thread waits for another thread to perform a task.A thread transitions back to the runnable state only when another thread signals the waiting thread to continue executing.It is one in which the thread is waiting becauseof the following factors: For the repeating CPU, burst time of the thread(CPU burst time is an amount of the required by the thread by the CPU).

Following is simple syntax of run method: public void run( ) Step 2: At second step you will instantiate a Thread object using the following constructor: Thread(Runnable threadObj, String threadName); Where, threadObj is an instance of a class that implements the Runnable interface and threadName is the name given to the new thread. Step 3 Once Thread object is created, you can start it by calling start method, which executes a call to run method.

Thread class is the main class on which Java's Multithreading system is based. Creating a flow of control in JAVA is nothing but creating an object of java.lang.Thread class. An object of Thread class can be created in three ways. They are: Directly Thread t=new Thread (); Using factory method Thread t1=Thread.currentThread (); Using sub-class of Thread class class C1 extends Thread { \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ; \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ; }; C1 o1 = new C1 (); Threadt1 = new C1 (); Here, C1 is the sub-class ofThread class. Thread API: Constructors of Thread class Thread ( ) Thread ( String str ) Thread ( Runnable r ) Thread ( Runnable r, String str) Thread () : With this Constructor, we can create an object of the Thread class whose default thread name is Thread-0. For example: Thread t=new Thread (); System.out.println (t.getName ());// Thread-0 Thread (String str) : This Constructor is used for creating a thread and we can give the user specified thread name. For example: Thread t=new Thread (\u201cJAVA\u201d); t.setName (\u201cJAVA\u201d); t.setPriority (Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); Thread (Runnable r): This Constructor is used for converting Runnable object into Thread object for entering into run method of Runnable interface by making use of start method of Thread class without giving thread name. Thread (Runnable r, String str): This Constructor is similar to above Constructor but we give thread name through this Constructor. The second way to create a thread is to create a new class that extends Thread class using the following two simple steps. This approach provides more flexibility in handling multiple threads created using available methods in Thread class. Step 1 You will need to override run method available in Thread class. This method provides entry point for the thread and you will put you complete business logic inside this method.

This is the method which is used for making the Thread to start to execute the thread logic. The method start is internally calling the method run (). For example: Thread t1=new Thread (); t1.start (); Thread t2=Thread.currentThread (); t2.start (); public final void suspend (): This method is used for suspending the thread from current execution of thread. When the thread is suspended, it sends to waiting state by keeping the temporary results in process control block (PCB) or job control block (JCB). public void run() : If this Thread object was instantiated using a separate Runnable target, the run method is invoked on that Runnable object. Any JAVA programmer want to define a logic for the thread that logic must be defined only run () method. When the thread is started, the JVM looks for the appropriate run () method for executing the logic of the thread. Thread class is a concrete class and it contains all defined methods and all these methods are being to final except run () method. run () method is by default contains a definition with null body. Since we are providing the logic for the thread in run () method. Hence it must be overridden by extending Thread class into our own class.

When the thread is resumed to start executing from where it left out previously by retrieving the previous result from PCB. public final void stop (): This method is used to stop the execution of the current thread and the thread goesto halted state from running state. When the thread is restarted, it starts executing from the beginning only. public final void wait (long msec): This method is used for making the currently executing thread into waiting state for a period of time.

So you will get output like r1 r1 r2 r2 Example of thread with join () method public class MyThread extends Thread { public void run () { System . out . println ( \"r1 \" ); try { Thread . sleep ( 500 ); } catch ( InterruptedException ie ){} System . out . println ( \"r2 \" ); } public static void main ( String [] args ) { MyThread t1 = new MyThread (); MyThread t2 = new MyThread (); t1 . start (); try { t1 . join (); //Waiting for t1 to finish } catch ( InterruptedException ie ){} t2 . start (); } } Output r1 r2 r1 r2 In this above program join() method on thread t1 ensure that t1 finishes it process before thread t2 starts. Specifying time with join() If in the above program, we specify time while using join() with m1, then m1 will execute for that time, and then m2 and m3 will join it. m1.join(1500); Doing so, initially m1 will execute for 1.5 seconds, after which m2 and m3 will join it.","title":"Joining Thread"},{"location":"java/UnitIV/#synchronization","text":"At times when more than one thread try to access a shared resource, we need to ensure that resource will be used by only one thread at a time. The process by which this is achieved is called synchronization. The synchronization keyword in java creates a block of code referred to as critical section. Every Java object with a critical section of code gets a lock associated with the object. To enter critical section a thread need to obtain the corresponding object's lock. General Syntax : synchronized (object) { //statement to be synchronized } Why we use Syncronization ? If we do not use syncronization, and let two or more threads access a shared resource at the same time, it will lead to distorted results. Consider an example, Suppose we have two different threads T1 and T2, T1 starts execution and save certain values in a file temporary.txt which will be used to calculate some result when T1 returns. Meanwhile, T2 starts and before T1 returns, T2 change the values saved by T1 in the file temporary.txt (temporary.txt is the shared resource). Now obviously T1 will return wrong result. To prevent such problems, synchronization was introduced. With synchronization in above case, once T1 starts using temporary.txt file, this file will be locked(LOCK mode), and no other thread will be able to access or modify it until T1 returns. Using Synchronized Methods Using Synchronized methods is a way to accomplish synchronization. But lets first see what happens when we do not use synchronization in our program. Example with no Synchronization class First { public void display ( String msg ) { System . out . print ( \"[\" + msg ); try { Thread . sleep ( 1000 ); } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { e . printStackTrace (); } System . out . println ( \"]\" ); } } class Second extends Thread { String msg ; First fobj ; Second ( First fp , String str ) { fobj = fp ; msg = str ; start (); } public void run () { fobj . display ( msg ); } } public class Syncro { public static void main ( String [] args ) { First fnew = new First (); Second ss = new second ( fnew , \"welcome\" ); Second ss1 = new second ( fnew , \"new\" ); Second ss2 = new second ( fnew , \"programmer\" ); } } Output : [ welcome [ new [ programmer ] ] ] In the above program, object fnew of class First is shared by all the three running threads(ss, ss1 and ss2) to call the shared method(void display). Hence the result is unsynchronized and such situation is called Race condition.","title":"Synchronization"},{"location":"java/UnitIV/#synchronized-keyword","text":"To synchronize above program, we must serialize access to the shared display() method, making it available to only one thread at a time.

When an Exception occurs the normal flow of the program is disrupted and the program/Application terminates abnormally, which is not recommended, therefore these exceptions are to be handled. An exception can occur for many different reasons, below given are some scenarios where exception occurs. A user has entered invalid data. A file that needs to be opened cannot be found. A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications or the JVM has run out of memory. Some of these exceptions are caused by user error, others by programmer error, and others by physical resources that have failed in some manner. Based on these we have three categories of Exceptions you need to understand them to know how exception handling works in Java, Checked exceptions: A checked exception is an exception that occurs at the compile time, these are also called as compile time exceptions. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored at the time of compilation, the Programmer should take care of handle these exceptions. For example, if you use FileReader class in your program to read data from a file, if the file specified in its constructor doesn't exist, then an FileNotFoundException occurs, and compiler prompts the programmer to handle the exception. import java.io.File ; import java.io.FileReader ; public class FilenotFound_Demo { public static void main ( String args []) { File file = new File ( \"E://file.txt\" ); FileReader fr = new FileReader ( file ); } } If you try to compile the above program you will get exceptions as shown below. FilenotFound_Demo.java:8: error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught or declared to be thrown FileReader fr = new FileReader(file); ^ 1 error Note: Since the methods read and close of FileReader class throws IOException, you can observe that compiler notifies to handle IOException, along with FileNotFoundException. Unchecked exceptions: An Unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution, these are also called as Runtime Exceptions, these include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation. For example, if you have declared an array of size 5 in your program, and trying to call the 6 th element of the array then an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionexception occurs.","title":"Finally Clause"},{"location":"java/UnitIV/#questions","text":"How to use handle the exception hierarchies?

They are standalone GUI applications and distributed GUI applications. A standalone GUI application is one which runs in the context of local disk and our class must extends a predefined class called java.lang.Frame class. A distributed GUI application is one which runs in the context of browser and our class must extend java.applet.Applet class. As a part of GUI applications we use to create two types of components. They are passive components and active components. A passive component is one where there is no interaction from the user. For example label An active component is one where there is an interaction from the user. For example button, check box, scroll bar, etc. The active and passive components in JAVA are available in terms of classes. In order to with any GUI applications we must import a package called java.awt.* (contains various classes and interfaces for creating GUI components) and java.awt.event.* (contains various classes and interfaces which will provide functionality to GUI components).

Any technology which runs in the browser will have \u2018n\u2019 number of life cycle methods and it does not contain main methods and System.out.println statements. In JAVA, SUN micro initially has developed a concept called applets which runs in the context of browser. An applet is a JAVA program which runs in the context of browser or World Wide Web. In order to deal with applets we must import a package called java.applet.*. This package contains only one class Applet whose fully qualified name is java.applet.Applet. Since applets are running in the browser, the class Applet contains the life cycle methods. Life cycle methods are also called as loop back methods. An applet is a Java program that runs in a Web browser. An applet can be a fully functional Java application because it has the entire Java API at its disposal. There are some important differences between an applet and a standalone Java application, including the following: An applet is a Java class that extends the java.applet.Applet class. A main() method is not invoked on an applet, and an applet class will not define main(). Applets are designed to be embedded within an HTML page. When a user views an HTML page that contains an applet, the code for the applet is downloaded to the user's machine. A JVM is required to view an applet. The JVM can be either a plug-in of the Web browser or a separate runtime environment. The JVM on the user's machine creates an instance of the applet class and invokes various methods during the applet's lifetime. Applets have strict security rules that are enforced by the Web browser. The security of an applet is often referred to as sandbox security, comparing the applet to a child playing in a sandbox with various rules that must be followed. Other classes that the applet needs can be downloaded in a single Java Archive (JAR) file. Life Cycle of an Applet: Link Five methods in the Applet class give you the framework on which you build any serious applet: Public void init () : This is the method which is called by the browser only one time after loading the applet. In this method we write some block of statements which will perform one time operations, such as, obtaining the resources like opening the files, obtaining the database connection, initializing the parameters, etc. This method is intended for whatever initialization is needed for your applet. It is called after the param tags inside the applet tag have been processed. Public void start () : After calling the init method, the next method which is from second request to sub-sequent requests the start method only will be called i.e., short method will be called each and every time. In this method we write the block of statement which provides business logic. This method is automatically called after the browser calls the init method. It is also called whenever the user returns to the page containing the applet after having gone off to other pages. Public void stop (): This id the method which is called by the browser when we minimize the window. In this method we write the block of statements which will temporarily releases the resources which are obtained in init method. This method is automatically called when the user moves off the page on which the applet sits. It can, therefore, be called repeatedly in the same applet. Public void destroy () : This is the method which will be called by the browser when we close the window button or when we terminate the applet application. In this method we write same block of statements which will releases the resources permanently which are obtained in init method.This method is only called when the browser shuts down normally. Because applets are meant to live on an HTML page, you should not normally leave resources behind after a user leaves the page that contains the applet. paint: Invoked immediately after the start() method, and also any time the applet needs to repaint itself in the browser. The paint() method is actually inherited from the java.awt. Another method which is not a life cycle method is public void paint (). This is the method which will be called by the browser after completion of start method. This method is used for displaying the data on to the browser. Paint method is internally calling the method called drawString whose prototype is given below. java.awt.Graphics (Graphics => public void drawString (String, int row position, int column position)) An object of Graphics class will be created automatically after loading the applet into the browser. STEPS for developing APPLET PROGRAM: Link Import java.applet.Applet package. Choose the user defined class that must extends java.applet.Applet class and ensure the modifier of the class must be public. Overwrite the life cycle methods of the applet if require. Save the program and compile. Run the applet: To run the applet we have two ways. They are using HTML program and using applet viewer tool. Using HTML program: In order to run the applet through HTML program we must use the following tag. Syntax: < applet code = . class file of the applet height = height value width = width value ></ applet > <!-- For example : File name : MyApp . html --> < HTML > < HEAD > < TITLE > My applet example </ TITLE > </ HEAD > < BODY > < APPLET code = \"MyApp\" height = 100 width = 150 > </ APPLET > </ BODY > </ HTML > AWT: Abstract WindowingToolkit Link In JAVA we can developto types of GUI (Graphic User Interface) applications.

They are: In order to process any active components, we must know either name or caption or label or reference of the component (object).

Because applets are meant to live on an HTML page, you should not normally leave resources behind after a user leaves the page that contains the applet. paint: Invoked immediately after the start() method, and also any time the applet needs to repaint itself in the browser. The paint() method is actually inherited from the java.awt. Another method which is not a life cycle method is public void paint (). This is the method which will be called by the browser after completion of start method. This method is used for displaying the data on to the browser. Paint method is internally calling the method called drawString whose prototype is given below. java.awt.Graphics (Graphics => public void drawString (String, int row position, int column position)) An object of Graphics class will be created automatically after loading the applet into the browser.","title":"Life Cycle of an Applet:"},{"location":"java/UnitV/#steps-for-developing-applet-program","text":"Import java.applet.Applet package.

They are standalone **GUI applications and **distributed **GUI applications. A **standalone GUI application is one which runs in the context of local disk and our classmust extends a predefined class called java.lang.frame. A **distributed GUIapplication **is one which runs in the context of browser and our class mustextend java.applet.Applet class. As a part of GUIapplications we use to create two types of components. They are passive components **and **Active Components A **passive component **isone where there is no interaction from the user. For example label. An **active component **is one where there is an interaction from the user. For examplebutton, check box, scroll bar, etc. The **active andpassive components **in JAVA are available in terms of classes. In order todeal with any GUI applications we must import a package called java.awt. (contains various classes and interfaces for creating GUI components) andjava.awt.event. (contains various classes and interfaces which will providefunctionality to GUI components). **AWT Hierarchy Chart: **Whenever we develop anyGUI application we must have readily available window component and windowcomponent must contain frame component. Any GUI component which we want tocreate gives the corresponding class and Container class. AContainer is a class whose object allows us to add \u2018n\u2019 number of similar ordifferent GUI components to make a final application Except Object class andApplet class all the classes in the a to java.awt.* package. Label class : Label is a class whichis used for creating label as a part of windows application. The componentlabel comes under passive component. Labels always improve the functionalityand readability of active components. Creating a label is nothing but creatingan object of label components. Label class API: Data members: publicstatic final int LEFT ( 0 ) publicstatic final int CENTER ( 1 ) publicstatic final int RIGHT ( 2 ) Theabove three statements are called alignment parameters or modifiers. Constructors: Label () Label ( String ) Label ( String label name , int alignment modifier ) Instance methods: public void setText ( String ); public String getText (); public void setAlignment ( int ); public int getAlignment (); Write a JAVA programwhich creates Window and Frame? import java.awt.* ; class myf extends Frame { Myf () { setText ( \u201c AshaKrishna \u201d ); setSize ( 100 , 100 ); setBackground ( Colo setForeground ( Color , red ); setVisible ( true ); } } class FDemo { Public static void main ( String [] args ) { Myf mo = new myf (); } } Event Delegation Model Whenever we want to develop any windows applications one must deal with event delegation model.Event delegation model contains four properties. They are: In order to process any active components, we must know either name or caption or label or reference of the component (object). Whenever we interact any active component,the corresponding active component will have one predefined Event class, whoseobject will be created and that object contains two details: Name of the component. Reference of the component. The general form of every Event class is xxx event.","title":"AWT: Abstract WindowingToolkit"},{"location":"java/Visibility%20Controls/","text":"Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods, and constructors. Access Modifiers are used at 2 access levels in Java. Top-level for Classes & Interfaces Default Visible to the same package only. not accessible in other packages or sub packages do not explicitly declare Public Visible to the world Member-level for Classes & Interfaces Public Visible to the world Protected Visible to the package and all subclasses of its class in any package where this class is visible. Default Visible to the same package only. not accessible in other packages or sub packages do not explicitly declare Private Visible to the class only Non-Access Modifiers Static Members Static members are the members with Static keyword in their declarations. Class variables are called as Static variables. These members belong to the class not to the object i.e. they are not instantiated when the class instance is created. The values of these variables are not part of the object state. The static variables are initialized to their default values (if explicit initialization is not specified) at the time of class loading. The Static methods are called as class methods. A static method can directly access other static members in the class. It cannot access instance (non-static) members of the class. But it can always use a reference of the class type to access its members both static and non-static. Final Member Final variable is a constant; its value cannot be changed after its initialization. This applies to instance, static and local variables including parameters that are declared as final. A final variable of primitive data type cannot change its value once it has been initialized. A final variable of a reference type cannot change its reference value once it has been initialized, but the state of the object it denotes can still be changed. Note Variables defined in Interfaces are implicitly Final. Final variables must be initialized before it is used. Final methods in a class are complete i.e. these methods have implementations and hence cannot be overridden in the subclasses. Abstract If method has a keyword abstract in its declaration, then such method/function is called Abstract method. Abstract methods do not have an implementation i.e. method body is not defined; only method prototype is specified in the class definition. Note: Only instance methods can be declared as abstract. Since Static methods cannot be overridden declaring abstract static method would of no use. A Final method cannot be abstract and vice versa. Methods specified in an Interface are implicitly abstract. Class: Contains abstract methods. Cannot be instantiated Interface: All interfaces are implicitly abstract. The modifier is optional. Method: Method without a body. Signature is followed by a semicolon. The class must also be abstract. Synchronized Methods: Multiple threads can be executing in a program and at times they might try to execute several methods on the same object simultaneously. If there is a requirement that only one thread at a time should execute a method in the object, then such methods can be declared as Synchronized. Their execution will be mutually exclusive among all threads. At any given time, at the most one thread will be executing a Synchronized method on an object. Note Synchronized methods are also applicable to Static methods of a class. Native Methods Native Methods are also called as Foreign methods. Such methods implementation is not defined in Java but in another programming language. These methods are specified in the class as method prototypes with prefix with keyword native, no method body is defined in the Java class. Transient Fields Objects can be stored using serialization. Serialization transforms objects into an output format which is helpful for storing objects. Objects can later be retrieved in the same state as when they were serialized, meaning that fields included in the serialization will have the same values at the time of serialization. Such objects are said to be Persistent. The fields are declared with keyword Transient in their class declaration if its value should not be saved when objects of the class are written to persistent storage. Volatile Fields During execution, complied code might cache the values of fields for efficiency reasons. And as multiple threads will access the same field, caching is not allowed to cause inconsistencies when reading and writing the value in the field. The Volatile modifier can be used to inform the compiler that it should not attempt to perform optimizations on the field which could cause unpredicted results when the field is accessed by multiple threads Accessibility Modifiers for Nested Classes & Interfaces Nested Interfaces Access modifiers can be used in Nested interfaces. An interface declared within another class or interface is called a Nested interface. A top-level interface is the one which is not nested. Only one type of nested interface is available in Java based on declarative context, Static member interface. These are interfaces defined with keyword Static inside the top-level interface or class or in another Static member class or interface. It can be instantiated like a normal top-level interface or class, no enclosing instance is required for this interface instantiation. Nested Classes Access modifiers are also used in Nested classes. A class declared within another class is called a Nested class. A top-level class is the one which is not nested. They are 2 categories of Nested classes based on the declarative context. They are Static member classes Inner classes Inner classes are defined in 3 different categories. They are Non-static member classes Local classes Anonymous classes Static member classes Classes which are defined with Static modifier inside the top-level class or other Static member class are called Static member classes. It can be instantiated like a normal top-level class; no enclosing instance is required for this class instantiation. All the 4 accessibility modifiers i.e. Public, Protected, Package & Private are applicable to Static member classes\u2019 declaration. Non-Static member classes Classes which are defined without Static modifier inside another class are called non-static member classes. An instance of a non-static member class always has an enclosing instance associated with it. The accessibility modifiers i.e. Public, Protected, Package & Private,abstract, final are applicable to Non-Static member classes\u2019 declaration. Local classes These classes are defined in the context of a block as in a body of the method or normal local block, just as local variables defined in a method body or local block. An instance of a local class has an enclosing instance associated with it, if it is declared in non-static context. No accessibility modifiers are applicable for Local classes. Anonymous classes These are defined as expressions and instantiated on the fly. An instance of anonymous class has an enclosing instance associated with it, if it is declared in non-static context. No accessibility modifiers are applicable for Anonymous classes. Note A Nested Class or Interface cannot have the same name as any of the enclosing classes or interfaces.","title":"Visibility Controls"},{"location":"java/Practice/Set%2001/","text":"B.E./B.Tech.
